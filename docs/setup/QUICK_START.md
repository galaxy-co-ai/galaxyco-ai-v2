# üöÄ Quick Start Guide

**Welcome to GalaxyCo.ai 2.0!** This guide will get you up and running in ~30 minutes.

---

## ‚úÖ What We've Done So Far

- ‚úÖ Created clean monorepo structure
- ‚úÖ Added all configuration files (package.json, turbo.json, tsconfig, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive documentation (README, SECRETS_CHECKLIST)
- ‚úÖ Created `.env.example` templates for all services
- ‚úÖ Initialized git repository

---

## üéØ Your Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Review What We Built (5 minutes)

1. Open `README.md` - Overview of the entire project
2. Open `SECRETS_CHECKLIST.md` - Complete list of all accounts and secrets needed
3. Open `GALAXYCO_2.0_ANALYSIS_AND_PLAN.md` - Full project plan with 17 phases

### Step 2: Create Priority Accounts (20-30 minutes)

Focus on the **Immediate** tier first (required for local development):

#### 1. Neon Database (5 min) ‚úÖ HIGH PRIORITY

- Go to: https://neon.tech
- Sign up (free tier available)
- Create project: `galaxyco-ai`
- Create database: `galaxyco`
- **Copy connection string** ‚Üí Save to `SECRETS_CHECKLIST.md`

#### 2. Upstash Redis (3 min) ‚úÖ HIGH PRIORITY

- Go to: https://upstash.com
- Sign up (free tier available)
- Create database: `galaxyco-redis`
- **Copy connection string** ‚Üí Save to `SECRETS_CHECKLIST.md`

#### 3. Clerk Authentication (5 min) ‚úÖ HIGH PRIORITY

- Go to: https://clerk.com
- Sign up (free for development)
- Create application: `GalaxyCo.ai`
- Get keys from Dashboard ‚Üí API Keys
- **Copy publishable key and secret key** ‚Üí Save to `SECRETS_CHECKLIST.md`
- Configure redirect URLs:
  - Add: `http://localhost:3000`

#### 4. OpenAI API (5 min) ‚úÖ HIGH PRIORITY

- Go to: https://platform.openai.com
- Sign up / Log in
- Navigate to API Keys
- Create new key: `galaxyco-dev`
- **Set spending limit**: $100-200/month
- **Copy API key** ‚Üí Save to `SECRETS_CHECKLIST.md`

---

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables (10 minutes)

Now that you have your accounts, let's configure the apps:

#### Web App (.env.local)

```bash
cd apps/web
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local and add:
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
```

#### API (.env.local)

```bash
cd apps/api
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local and add:
# - DATABASE_URL (from Neon)
# - REDIS_URL (from Upstash)
# - CLERK_SECRET_KEY (from Clerk)
```

#### Agents Service (.env)

```bash
cd services/agents
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add:
# - DATABASE_URL (from Neon)
# - REDIS_URL (from Upstash)
# - OPENAI_API_KEY (from OpenAI)
```

**üí° Tip**: Keep a secure local copy of `SECRETS_CHECKLIST.md` with all your actual values filled in!

---

### Step 4: Install Dependencies (5 minutes)

```bash
# Install pnpm if you don't have it
npm install -g pnpm@9

# Install all project dependencies
pnpm install
```

This will install dependencies for all workspaces (web, api, packages).

---

### Step 5: Verify Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# Check that everything compiles
pnpm typecheck

# Check that linting works
pnpm lint
```

If there are no errors, you're ready to start building! üéâ

## üé¨ What's Next?

### Option A: Continue with Phase 2 (Recommended)

We're currently in **Phase 2: Repository Initialization**.

**Next tasks**:

1. Initialize Next.js app in `apps/web`
2. Initialize NestJS app in `apps/api`
3. Set up Python FastAPI in `services/agents`
4. Create basic health check endpoints
5. Make first commit

**I can help you with this now!** Just say: _"Let's continue with Phase 2"_

---

### Option B: Move to Phase 1 (Account Setup)

If you want to set up more accounts before coding:

**Additional accounts to set up**:

- Vercel (for web deployment)
- AWS (for infrastructure)
- GitHub (for code hosting & CI/CD)
- Stripe (for billing - test mode)

**I can guide you through this!** Just say: _"Let's finish Phase 1 first"_

---

### Option C: Jump to Phase 3 (Infrastructure)

If you want to provision AWS infrastructure with Terraform:

**Prerequisites**:

- AWS account ready
- Terraform installed
- AWS CLI configured

**I can help you with this!** Just say: _"Let's set up infrastructure"_

---

## üìã Current Project Status

‚úÖ **Completed**:

- Project structure created
- Git initialized
- Configuration files ready
- Documentation complete
- `.env.example` templates created

üîÑ **In Progress**:

- Phase 2: Repository Initialization
- Need to create actual app scaffolds

‚è≠Ô∏è **Next Up**:

- Install and configure Next.js
- Install and configure NestJS
- Set up Python FastAPI
- Create first health check endpoints

## üÜò Need Help?

### Common Issues

**"I don't have pnpm"**

```bash
npm install -g pnpm@9
```

**"I don't have Node 20+"**

- Download from: https://nodejs.org (LTS version)

**"I don't have Python 3.11+"**

- Windows: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Use Python 3.11 or 3.12

**"Where do I save my secrets?"**

- Create a copy of `SECRETS_CHECKLIST.md` called `SECRETS_CHECKLIST_FILLED.md`
- Add it to `.gitignore` (already included)
- Fill in your actual values there

**"Which accounts should I prioritize?"**
For local development, you ONLY need:

1. Neon (database)
2. Upstash (redis)
3. Clerk (auth)
4. OpenAI (LLM)

Everything else can wait!

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Get the 4 priority accounts first, everything else can wait
2. **Keep Secrets Secure**: Use a password manager or encrypted file for secrets
3. **Test Mode Everything**: Use test/dev keys for all services during development
4. **Set Spending Limits**: Especially on OpenAI ($100-200/month is plenty for MVP)
5. **Document As You Go**: Fill in `SECRETS_CHECKLIST.md` as you get each key

---

## üéØ Decision Time!

**What would you like to do next?**

A) Continue Phase 2 - Build the apps (Recommended ‚≠ê)
B) Finish Phase 1 - Set up more accounts
C) Jump to Phase 3 - Set up infrastructure
D) Something else - Tell me what's most important

**Just let me know and I'll guide you through it step-by-step!**

**Remember**: You've already accomplished a lot! The foundation is solid. Now we just need to build on it. üöÄ
