## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Staging Deployment

1. [ ] Deploy to staging environment
2. [ ] Run smoke tests on staging
3. [ ] Verify mock mode execution works
4. [ ] Verify live mode execution works (if AI keys available)
5. [ ] Check Sentry for any new errors
6. [ ] Performance test with realistic load

### Step 2: Production Deployment

1. [ ] **STOP** - Do not deploy on Friday after 2pm or before holidays
2. [ ] Notify team in Discord #deployments channel
3. [ ] Deploy frontend (apps/web) to Vercel
4. [ ] Deploy backend (apps/api) to AWS ECS
5. [ ] Deploy Python service (services/agents) to AWS ECS
6. [ ] Verify all services are healthy

### Step 3: Post-Deployment Verification

1. [ ] Health check all services
2. [ ] Test mock mode execution in production
3. [ ] Test live mode execution (if AI keys configured)
4. [ ] Monitor Sentry for 15 minutes for errors
5. [ ] Check performance metrics
6. [ ] Verify logging is working properly

## 🌍 Environment Variables Required

### Python Service (services/agents)

```bash
# Required for live mode
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...           # Never commit to git
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...    # Never commit to git

# Optional
ENV=production
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
PYTHON_AGENTS_URL=https://agents.galaxyco.ai
```

### Next.js API (apps/web)

```bash
# Already configured
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=***            # Authentication
DATABASE_URL=***                # Postgres (Neon)
PYTHON_AGENTS_URL=***           # Python service URL
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Performance Targets

- **Mock Mode**: <500ms response time
- **Live Mode**: <3s response time
- **Error Rate**: <1% of executions
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability

### User Experience

- TestPanel loads quickly
- Clear error messages displayed
- Proper loading states shown
- Metrics display correctly

---

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

### If Issues Occur

1. **Check Sentry** for error patterns
2. **Check service logs** for detailed error info
3. **Disable live mode** by setting `PYTHON_AGENTS_URL=""`
4. **Rollback commits** if critical issues found
5. **Notify users** via Discord if downtime expected

### Quick Fixes

- **Mock mode issues**: Check API route logic
- **Live mode issues**: Check Python service connectivity
- **UI issues**: Verify TestPanel component state
- **Auth issues**: Check Clerk configuration
