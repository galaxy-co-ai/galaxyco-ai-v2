## 📈 Metrics & KPIs

### Development Speed
- **Before**: Manual checks, frequent backtracking
- **After Phase 1**: Health checks automated, incidents documented
- **Target**: 30% faster iteration cycles

### Incident Response
- **Before**: Ad-hoc debugging, no documentation
- **After Phase 1**: Structured incident reports, runbooks
- **Target**: <30min to diagnose common issues

### Code Quality
- **Current**: Manual reviews
- **Target**: Automated checks on every save
- **Goal**: Zero production bugs from missed checks
