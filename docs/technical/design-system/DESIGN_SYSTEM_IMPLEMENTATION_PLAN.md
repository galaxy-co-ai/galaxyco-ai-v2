## 🎨 Design Decisions

### 1. Theme Direction: **Light + Dark** ✅
- **Default theme:** Light (current aesthetic)
- **Dark theme:** OpenSea-inspired (deep navy/charcoal backgrounds)
- **Toggle:** Theme switcher in top bar
- **Persistence:** Local storage via next-themes

**Rationale:** Dual theme support is a modern expectation, especially for power users who work long hours. OpenSea's dark aesthetic provides excellent reference for marketplace-style interfaces.

### 2. Technology Stack: **Tailwind + CSS Variables** ✅
- **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid development and utility classes
- **CSS Variables:** For theme tokens (colors, spacing, shadows)
- **Benefits:** Best of both worlds—Tailwind's speed + theme flexibility

**Rationale:** This combination is industry-standard (used by Vercel, shadcn/ui, and many modern SaaS products) and provides maximum flexibility.

### 3. Component Library: **shadcn/ui** ✅
- **Pros:** Owns the code, fully customizable, accessible, TypeScript-native
- **Alternatives considered:** Radix UI (too low-level), Headless UI (less features), custom components (inconsistent)

**Rationale:** shadcn/ui strikes the perfect balance—production-ready components that you can customize and own, built on Radix UI primitives for accessibility.

### 4. Layout: **Sidebar + Top Bar (Hybrid)** ✅
- **Keep sidebar:** Better for multi-section platforms
- **Add top bar:** For global actions (search, notifications, theme toggle)
- **Mobile:** Drawer for sidebar, persistent top bar

**Rationale:** Your platform has multiple complex features (agents, knowledge, marketplace, dashboard). A sidebar provides better navigation UX than a top navbar. Top bar adds global utilities.

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks:
1. **Breaking existing functionality** during migration
   - **Mitigation:** Phased approach, commit often, test after each phase
2. **Theme inconsistencies** between light and dark modes
   - **Mitigation:** Define all tokens upfront, test both themes continuously
3. **Performance degradation** from adding animations/components
   - **Mitigation:** Lighthouse testing in Phase 7, optimize before deployment
4. **Accessibility regressions**
   - **Mitigation:** Test keyboard nav and screen reader after each phase
5. **Scope creep** (adding features beyond design system)
   - **Mitigation:** Stick to the plan, document future enhancements separately
