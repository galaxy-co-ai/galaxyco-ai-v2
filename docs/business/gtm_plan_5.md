# GalaxyCo.ai — GTM Plan (5.3)

## Purpose
Operationalize how we acquire, activate, and expand customers from Day‑0 through V2. Anchored to our **North Star (WSAO)**, **≤90s onboarding**, **Packs by default**, **PAA on Day‑1**, and inspirations: **StackAI** (polish), **OpenSea** (marketplace cards), **OpenAI Agent Builder** (friendly building), **Sider** (human knowledge UI).

---

## ICPs & Segments (order of attack)
1) **Founder‑led SMBs (10–100 employees)** — need speed; low IT friction; ready for PLG self‑serve.
2) **Department teams in mid‑market (100–1k)** — Sales, Support, Ops; willing to pilot; need governance.
3) **Select enterprise design partners** — security‑sensitive; co‑create requirements for V2 (SSO/SCIM, residency).

**Primary personas** (per 2.1): Founder, Sales, Ops, Support, Finance, Product — with **industry overlays** (SaaS B2B, E‑com, Healthcare, ProServ, Manufacturing).

---

## Positioning (one‑slide recap)
*Make multi‑agent AI useful in minutes.* Personalized dashboard, curated **Packs**, and a **Personal AI Assistant** that never lets you get stuck. Visual simplicity + DSL power. KPIs on cards; every answer cited.

---

## Offers & Entry Points (by persona)
- **Founder Ops** → “Never miss a follow‑up. Weekly CEO report on autopilot.” (Starter Pack + Sim Mode)
- **Sales** → “Follow‑ups drafted, CRM clean, meetings scheduled.” (Sequencer add‑on prompt Day‑3)
- **Support** → “Triage + macros + FAQ updates with citations.” (Sentiment Watch add‑on prompt Week‑2)
- **Ops** → “Weekly ops report with anomaly flags.” (Warehouse connector nudge after first report)
- **Finance** → “Close checklist + reconciliation assistant.” (Materiality threshold wizard)
- **Product** → “Feedback summaries → PRD draft in minutes.” (Quotes Collector add‑on prompt)

CTA everywhere: **Create my workspace** → **Starter Pack installed** → **Preview with sample data**.

---

## Motions
### A) Product‑Led (PLG)
- **North Star path**: Sign up → 6‑step onboarding (≤90s) → dashboard never blank → run first **WSAO** via sample data in ≤10 min → PAA suggests “next best action.”
- **In‑product growth loops**
  - Shareable **trace links** from outcomes → drive referrals.
  - **“Install from trace”** button appears on demo pages and showcases.
  - PAA prompts: “Connect CRM for 20% more outcomes,” “Add Sequencer agent?”
- **Activation triggers**
  - D0: Run one sample outcome.
  - D1: Connect at least one tool OR install a second agent.
  - D7: Accept PAA weekly review suggestion.

### B) Sales‑Assisted (SMB/MM)
- **PQL definition**: any workspace with ≥1 WSAO and ≥1 integration or ≥3 marketplace installs.
- **Routing**: PQL → AE for 20‑min consultative demo.
- **Demo spine** (live WSAO):
  1) 60‑sec onboarding recap.
  2) Run a Pack in **Sim Mode** → show citations and KPIs.
  3) Open **Traces** → reliability, latency, cost.
  4) Flip to **DSL** → confidence we’re not trapped in no‑code.
  5) PAA **Weekly Review** → propose improvements → apply with approvals.
- **Discovery questions** (5): role/industry, top 2 pains, tools today, approval sensitivity, success this quarter.

### C) Enterprise Pilot (select)
- 4–8 week pilot; success plan tied to WSAO uplift and governance checks.
- Gate: security review, data residency needs; roadmap alignment for SSO/SCIM (V2).
