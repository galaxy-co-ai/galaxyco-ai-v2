# ✅ Documentation Organization - Complete

## What We Accomplished

Successfully reorganized the entire GalaxyCo.ai v2.0 project documentation into a clean, intuitive, and maintainable structure.

## Before & After

### Before
- 154+ markdown files scattered throughout the project
- 17+ files at project root
- Confusing navigation
- Lots of duplication
- No clear organization
- Hard to find information

### After
- Clean project root (only README.md, WARP.md, QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
- Organized docs/ folder with clear categories
- Master documentation hub with navigation
- Category README files for easy browsing
- Clear naming conventions
- Easy to find anything

## New Structure
