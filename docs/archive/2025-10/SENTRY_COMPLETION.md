**Completed**: October 11, 2025  
**Duration**: ~20 minutes  
**Commit**: `6735844`

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Error Boundaries (Production-Ready)

**Files Created:**

- `apps/web/components/error-boundary.tsx` - Reusable error boundary component
- `apps/web/app/error.tsx` - Root-level error handler
- `apps/web/app/dashboard/error.tsx` - Dashboard-specific error handler

**Features:**

- Automatically captures all React errors
- Sends errors to Sentry with full context
- Displays user-friendly error UI
- Shows error digest for support tracking
- Includes "Try Again" recovery button

### 2. ✅ Agent Execution Tracking (Production-Ready)

**Modified:**

- `packages/agents-core/src/runner.ts`

**Tracking Added:**

- **Transaction tracking** for full agent execution lifecycle
- **Span tracking** for individual tool executions
- **Error capture** with full context:
  - Agent ID, name, and model
  - Workspace and user IDs
  - Tool names and arguments
  - Iteration count and duration
  - Tokens used and cost

**Performance Monitoring:**

- Execution duration per agent run
- Tool execution latency
- Token usage patterns
- Cost per execution

### 3. ✅ Automated Monitoring Script (Production-Ready)

**Files:**

- `scripts/monitor-deployment.sh` - Enhanced with Sentry CLI
- `scripts/test-sentry.js` - Test event sender

**Features:**

- Real-time site availability check
- Health endpoint monitoring
- Sentry error count reporting
- Git commit tracking
- Continuous watch mode (`--watch`)
- Color-coded output for quick status assessment

### 4. ✅ Documentation (Complete)

**Created:**

- `docs/SENTRY_SETUP.md` - Step-by-step auth token setup guide
- `docs/SENTRY_COMPLETION.md` - This completion summary

## 🚀 How to Use

### View Errors in Sentry Dashboard

```
https://sentry.io/organizations/galaxyco-ai/issues/
```

### Test Sentry Integration

```bash
# Send test event
SENTRY_DSN="https://699c1bed0c2be84c0d98970d34c68923@o4510119201603584.ingest.us.sentry.io/4510162095539328" \
  sentry-cli send-event -m "Test event" --level info
```

### Run Monitoring Script

```bash
# Single check
./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh

# Continuous monitoring (every 30 seconds)
./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh --watch
```

### Enable Automated Error Fetching (Optional)

See `docs/SENTRY_SETUP.md` for creating an auth token to enable:

- Real-time error counts from terminal
- Unresolved issue listings
- Top error summaries

---

## 🔍 Testing Verification

### ✅ Test Events Sent

- **Event 1**: `00a74cc0-9180-4f51-9f85-827d748cca2b` (info)
- **Event 2**: `8429cdfb-3e6e-416c-9bd3-94adc0db541f` (error)

Both successfully received by Sentry.

### ✅ Integration Tests

- Error boundaries render correctly
- Sentry client config verified
- DSN configured in production environment
- Monitoring script runs successfully

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional)

### For Enhanced Monitoring (5 minutes)

1. Create Sentry auth token (see `docs/SENTRY_SETUP.md`)
2. Set `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable
3. Run monitoring script to see real-time error counts

### For Team Collaboration

1. Invite team members to Sentry organization
2. Set up Slack/Discord notifications for errors
3. Configure alert rules for critical errors

### For Advanced Features

1. Set up release tracking with git tags
2. Configure source maps for better stack traces
3. Add custom tags for environment/feature flags

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

✅ **No sensitive data logged** - guardrails prevent PII/secrets  
✅ **Multi-tenant isolation** - workspace/user IDs tracked  
✅ **Replay masking enabled** - all text/media masked by default  
✅ **Production-only tracking** - disabled in development  
✅ **Secure token storage** - auth tokens in environment variables
