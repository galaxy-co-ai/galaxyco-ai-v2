## 🚀 Sentry is Now Active!

Error monitoring is live in:

- ✅ Local development (when running `pnpm dev`)
- ✅ Production (after next deploy)
- ✅ Preview deployments (PR branches)

## 🧪 Quick Test

Visit http://localhost:3000 and open browser console. You should see Sentry initialized!

Or create a test error:

```typescript
// Add temporarily to any page
<button onClick={() => { throw new Error("Test Sentry"); }}>
  Test Error
</button>
```

## 📊 What Sentry Tracks

- ✅ JavaScript errors (unhandled exceptions)
- ✅ API route failures (500s)
- ✅ Performance metrics (slow pages)
- ✅ Session replays (for errors)
- ✅ User impact (how many affected)

## ⚙️ Recommended: Set Up Alerts (5 min)

1. Go to: https://galaxyco-ai.sentry.io/settings/projects/javascript-nextjs/alerts/
2. Create alert rule: "Users affected by an issue"
3. Send to email or Slack

## 🎉 Next: Deploy to Production

```bash
git add SENTRY_ACTIVATED.md
git commit -m "docs: mark Sentry as fully activated"
git push origin main
```

After deploy, all production errors will appear in Sentry! 🛡️
