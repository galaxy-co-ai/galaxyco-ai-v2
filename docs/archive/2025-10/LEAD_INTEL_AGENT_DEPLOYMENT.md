## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: Trigger.dev build fails with "Missing OPENAI_API_KEY"
**Solution:** Ensure environment variables are configured in Trigger.dev dashboard (not just Vercel)

### Issue: Task runs but returns empty results
**Solution:** 
1. Check that GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_API_KEY and ENGINE_ID are set
2. Verify the API keys are valid and have quota remaining
3. Check Trigger.dev run logs for specific errors

### Issue: Website scraping fails
**Solution:**
- Some websites block scrapers - this is expected behavior
- The agent returns partial data and marks confidence as "low"
- Try with different domains that allow scraping

### Issue: ICP fit score seems inaccurate
**Solution:**
- Review the ICP definition in the AI prompt (line 226-231 in lead-intel-agent.ts)
- Adjust the criteria to match your actual target customer profile
- The current ICP targets: B2B Professional Services, 10-50 employees, $1M-$10M revenue
