# 🧪 Quick Testing Guide - After UX Fixes

**Your Site**: https://galaxyco-ai-20.vercel.app/agents

## ✅ What's Fixed Now

1. **SSR Issue**: Mock agents now load properly on client-side
2. **Empty State**: Clear "Load Demo Agents" button
3. **Error Handling**: The "Failed to fetch" error should be gone
4. **User Flow**: Simple path from empty → demo data → testing

---

## 🚀 Quick Test (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Visit Your Site

Go to: https://galaxyco-ai-20.vercel.app/agents

**Expected**: You should see "Ready to test agent execution!" with a button

### Step 2: Load Demo Agents

Click the **"🎭 Load Demo Agents"** button

**Expected**: Page refreshes and shows 3 agent cards:

- 📧 Email Analyzer
- 📝 Meeting Summary
- ✨ Content Creator

### Step 3: Click Any Agent

Click on the **"📧 Email Analyzer"** card

**Expected**: Opens agent detail page with:

- Large agent icon and name
- Agent configuration details
- Prominent "🧪 Test Agent" buttons

### Step 4: Test the Agent

Click **"🧪 Test Agent"** button

**Expected**: TestPanel slides in from the right

### Step 5: Run a Test

1. The input already has sample JSON
2. Leave it in **Mock Mode** (🎭)
3. Click **"▶️ Run Test"**

**Expected**:

- Results appear in ~300ms
- See action items, priority, sentiment
- Metrics badges show tokens, cost, latency
- Success badge appears

## 🎯 If It Still Shows "Failed to fetch (localhost:4000)"

This means the old code is cached. Try:

1. **Hard Refresh**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (or `Cmd + Shift + R` on Mac)
2. **Clear Cache**: Open DevTools (F12) → Application → Clear storage
3. **Wait 2 minutes**: Vercel deployment might still be rolling out
