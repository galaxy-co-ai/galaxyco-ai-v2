I'm continuing work on GalaxyCo-ai 2.0. I've read `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`. 

We just completed **Phase 5 (Database Schema)** and are ready to start **Phase 6: Authentication & RBAC**.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ All 3 services operational (Next.js, NestJS, Python FastAPI)
- ✅ Database schema deployed to Neon (6 tables, multi-tenant)
- ✅ Drizzle ORM configured with security helpers
- ✅ 4/17 phases complete (23.5%)

**Phase 6 Goal:** Complete authentication end-to-end (2-3 hours)
- Integrate Clerk in Next.js
- User sync to database
- Workspace creation flow
- Protected API endpoints
- Multi-tenant security

The SESSION_HANDOFF.md has a detailed 6-step action plan. Let's execute it with the same precision we've maintained so far! 🚀
