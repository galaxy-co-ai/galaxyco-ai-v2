## 📝 What's Still Needed (Later)

**Phase 2 - Before Deployment**:

- [ ] Vercel account (for web hosting)
- [ ] AWS account (for infrastructure)
- [ ] GitHub repository setup (for CI/CD)
- [ ] Stripe account (for billing - test mode)

**Phase 3 - Production**:

- [ ] Sentry (error tracking)
- [ ] PostHog (analytics)
- [ ] Datadog (observability)
- [ ] Tool integrations (Gmail, Slack, HubSpot, etc.)

**These can all wait!** You have everything needed for local development.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option A: Continue Building (Recommended ⭐)

**Phase 2: Repository Initialization (continued)**

- Install Next.js in `apps/web`
- Install NestJS in `apps/api`
- Set up Python FastAPI in `services/agents`
- Create health check endpoints
- Verify all services start with `pnpm dev`

**I can help you with this now!**
