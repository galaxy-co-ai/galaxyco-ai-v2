## üß† Key Context

### **Architecture Stack**

- **Orchestration**: LangGraph (TypeScript) with StateGraph
- **AI Providers**: OpenAI (primary), Anthropic Claude (fallback)
- **Function Calling**: OpenAI strict mode for structured outputs
- **State Management**: SQLite checkpointing, Zod schemas
- **Real-Time**: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Database**: Postgres (Neon) with new tables for PAA, notifications, metrics

### **Dashboard Design** (from research)

- Single-column "Today" focus view
- 5 essential cards max
- Keyboard-first (A/D/S/W, ‚åòK)
- Calm notifications (ambient/batch/immediate levels)
- Progressive disclosure
- No dark patterns

### **AI Intelligence Pattern**

```
User Request
  ‚Üí PAA Intake (analyze)
  ‚Üí Planner (break into subtasks)
  ‚Üí Router (select specialist)
  ‚Üí Specialist (execute with approval)
  ‚Üí Critic (evaluate)
  ‚Üí PAA Summarize (user-facing outcome)
  ‚Üí Dashboard (real-time display)
```

### **PAA (Personal AI Assistant)**

- Runs silently in background (no chatbot UI)
- Watchtower: Detects issues every 5 min
- Optimizer: AI-powered suggestions daily
- Healer: Auto-fixes known issues
- All activity logged to database

## üìÅ Important Files

### **Documentation**

- `docs/planning/22_DAY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Complete plan with all phases
- `docs/planning/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` - This file
- `WARP.md` - Project rules and standards
- `README.md` - Project overview

### **Research Documents**

- User's dashboard research (markdown in chat)
- `~/OneDrive/Desktop/Docs for Warp Drive Ai/` - LangGraph, OpenAI, Claude docs

### **Current Codebase**

- `apps/web/` - Next.js frontend
- `services/agents/` - Python agent service (currently basic)
- `packages/database/` - Shared database package
- Existing: Basic dashboard, auth, agent execution (needs enhancement)

---

## üöÄ Next Actions (Priority Order)

### **Immediate (Day 1)**

1. Create `services/agents/core/` directory structure
2. Install LangGraph: `pip install langgraph`
3. Create `orchestrator.py` scaffolding
4. Define `AgentState` Zod schema
5. Set up SQLite checkpointer

### **Short-Term (Days 1-3)**

1. Complete LangGraph orchestrator
2. Build PAA intake, planner, router, critic nodes
3. Add human-in-the-loop approval
4. Write orchestrator tests
5. Mark Phase 1.1 complete

### **Mid-Term (Days 4-10)**

1. Build 3 specialist agents
2. Create PAA background service
3. Add intelligent model router
4. Integration testing

## üéØ Success Metrics

Track these as we build:

**AI Intelligence:**

- Agent success rate: ‚â•85%
- Average latency: <10s per outcome
- PAA auto-fix rate: % of issues resolved without user
- Cost per outcome: optimize over time

**Dashboard Performance:**

- Load time: <2s
- Time-to-triage: <30s median
- Days at inbox zero: track %
- Task throughput: vs baseline

**User Engagement:**

- Keyboard shortcut usage
- Notification volume per outcome (lower = better)
- Pin/save events (personalization)

## üí° Important Decisions Made

### **1. Why LangGraph?**

- Built-in state management with checkpointing
- Human-in-the-loop support out of box
- Visual debugging of execution graphs
- Retry/fallback logic included
- TypeScript support with Zod schemas

### **2. Why OpenAI Strict Mode?**

- Guaranteed schema adherence
- No hallucinated fields
- Reliable structured outputs
- Reduced prompt engineering

### **3. Why Calm Notifications?**

- User research shows notification spam reduces productivity
- Batch digests more effective than real-time alerts
- Ambient badges for routine events
- Immediate alerts only for critical (3 types)

### **4. Why Intelligence-First?**

- Dashboard is useless without real AI outcomes
- Building UI before data leads to rework
- Real outcomes inform dashboard design
- Validates core value prop early

### **5. Why PAA Background Service?**

- Proactive > reactive
- Auto-fixes reduce support burden
- AI-powered suggestions > manual rules
- Silent operation > chatbot clutter

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers & Risks

### **Current Blockers**

- None (ready to start)

### **Potential Risks**

1. **LangGraph Learning Curve**: Mitigated with docs provided
2. **Token Costs**: Mitigated with intelligent model router
3. **SSE at Scale**: Plan includes fallback to polling
4. **Timeline Aggressive**: 22 days with 70hr/week = achievable
5. **Context Loss**: Mitigated with this document
