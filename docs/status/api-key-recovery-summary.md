## ‚úÖ Completed Steps

   - Deleted `apps/web/.env.local.backup`
   - Enhanced `.gitignore` protection
   - Committed and pushed changes

## üîÑ What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Generate New API Keys (10 minutes)

#### OpenAI

1. Go to: **https://platform.openai.com/api-keys**
2. Click "Create new secret key"
3. Name: "GalaxyCo-Production-2025-10-12"
4. **COPY THE KEY IMMEDIATELY** (you won't see it again!)
5. Save in password manager

#### Anthropic

1. Go to: **https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys**
2. Click "Create Key"
3. Name: "GalaxyCo-Production-2025-10-12"
4. **COPY THE KEY IMMEDIATELY**
5. Save in password manager

### Step 2: Update Local Environment (2 minutes)

Open your `.env.local` file:

```bash
code apps/web/.env.local
```

Replace the OLD keys with your NEW keys:

```env
# OpenAI API Key (NEW - Generated 2025-10-12)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE

# Anthropic API Key (NEW - Generated 2025-10-12)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE
```

**Save the file.** DO NOT commit this file!

### Step 3: Update Vercel (If Deployed)

If you're using Vercel for deployment:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/YOUR_PROJECT/settings/environment-variables
2. Update `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your new key
3. Update `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` with your new key
4. Redeploy your application

### Step 4: Test Everything (5 minutes)

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, test the health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/agents/health?mode=quick
```

Expected response should show:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "ai_providers": {
    "openai": true,
    "anthropic": true
  }
}
```

## üìã Quick Checklist

- [ ] Generated new OpenAI API key
- [ ] Generated new Anthropic API key
- [ ] Updated `apps/web/.env.local` with new keys
- [ ] Updated Vercel environment variables (if deployed)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Old keys are INVALID** - Both providers auto-deactivated them
2. **Never commit `.env.local`** - It's already in `.gitignore`
3. **The exposed keys are removed from the main branch** - But remain in git history
4. **Optional:** Run `scripts/clean-git-history.sh` to remove from history permanently
