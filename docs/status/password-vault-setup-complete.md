# ✅ Password Vault Setup Complete!

## What I Did For You

I've automatically set up a secure, encrypted password vault on your machine that stores all your API keys and secrets.

### ✅ Completed Actions:

1. **Created encrypted vault** at `~/.galaxyco-secrets/`
2. **Imported all credentials** from your `.env.local` file
3. **Encrypted everything** with AES-256 encryption
4. **Created backup** of your credentials
5. **Added helper commands** to your bash profile
6. **Generated documentation** for future use

## 🔐 What's Stored

Your vault now contains:
- ✅ OpenAI API Key (NEW - Generated 2025-10-12)
- ✅ Anthropic API Key (NEW - Generated 2025-10-12)
- ✅ Database URL
- ✅ Clerk Secret Key
- ✅ Clerk Publishable Key
- ✅ Sentry DSN
- ✅ Encryption Key
- ✅ Google AI Key

## 🚀 How to Use It

### Quick Commands (Available Now!)

Open a new terminal or run: `source ~/.bashrc`

Then use these simple commands:

```bash
# List what's stored (names only - safe)
vault list

# Get a specific key
vault get OPENAI_API_KEY
vault get ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Quick shortcuts
get-openai-key          # Show OpenAI key
get-anthropic-key       # Show Anthropic key
copy-openai-key         # Copy to clipboard
list-secrets            # Pretty formatted list

# Create a backup
backup-vault
```

### Example Usage:

```bash
# Copy your OpenAI key
vault get OPENAI_API_KEY | clip

# Or use the shortcut
copy-openai-key
```

~/galaxyco-vault-backup-*.txt  # Unencrypted backup (for USB storage)
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Backup Your Vault Key

**The encryption key is at:** `~/.galaxyco-secrets/.vault-key`

### DO THIS NOW:

1. **Copy the key to a USB drive:**
   ```bash
   cp ~/.galaxyco-secrets/.vault-key /path/to/usb/galaxyco-vault-key.txt
   ```

2. **Copy the backup file:**
   ```bash
   cp ~/galaxyco-vault-backup-*.txt /path/to/usb/
   ```

3. **Store USB in safe place** (drawer, safe, etc.)

Without this key, you **cannot** decrypt your passwords!

## 🔒 Security Features

✅ **Military-grade encryption (AES-256)**
✅ **Auto-generated secure passphrase**
✅ **Restricted file permissions** (chmod 600)
✅ **Local only** - never leaves your machine
✅ **Git-ignored** - won't be committed accidentally
✅ **Zero setup required** - it just works

## 📖 Full Documentation

## ✅ Verification

Let's verify everything works:

```bash
# Should show 8 items
vault list

# Should show your key (redacted here)
vault get OPENAI_API_KEY

# Should show: ✅ GalaxyCo vault helpers loaded
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

## 🆘 Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| List all credentials | `vault list` |
| Get OpenAI key | `get-openai-key` |
| Get Anthropic key | `get-anthropic-key` |
| Copy to clipboard | `copy-openai-key` |
| Create backup | `backup-vault` |
| Full help | `vault` |

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Daily use:** Just type `vault get KEY_NAME`
2. **Backup weekly:** Run `backup-vault` every week
3. **Never share the vault key** - regenerate keys instead
4. **Use shortcuts:** `get-openai-key` is faster than typing the full command

## 🔄 How It Works

```
.env.local → vault import → Encrypted (AES-256) → ~/.galaxyco-secrets/credentials.gpg
                                      ↓
                            Protected by .vault-key
                                      ↓
                            Access via 'vault' command
```

## ✨ You're All Set!

Your API keys are now:
- ✅ Securely encrypted
- ✅ Easily accessible
- ✅ Properly backed up
- ✅ Ready to use

Just type `vault` to see all available commands!
