cd /c/Users/Owner/workspace/galaxyco-ai-2.0

# 2. Pull latest changes (if working from different machine)
git pull origin main

# 3. Start development server (if needed for reference)
cd apps/web && pnpm dev

# 4. Share wireframes/screenshots via:
#    - Upload images to chat
#    - Share Figma links
#    - Describe layouts in detail
