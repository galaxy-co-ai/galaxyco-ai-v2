**Last Updated**: 2025-01-19 18:25 UTC  
**Session Date**: January 19, 2025  
**Sprint**: Documentation + Production Readiness  
**Status**: 📚 Foundation Documentation Created

## 📚 Current Session: Foundation Documentation (Jan 19, 2025)

### What Was Built

**Documentation Created:**

1. **API Design Specification** (`docs/api/API_DESIGN_SPECIFICATION.md`)
   - Comprehensive 757-line specification document
   - Defines all API design standards for GalaxyCo.ai platform
   - **Sections covered:**
     - General REST principles and URL structure
     - Authentication & authorization (workspace RBAC)
     - Request/response format standards
     - Offset-based pagination (current pattern)
     - Filtering & sorting patterns
     - Zod validation schemas
     - Error handling with HTTP status codes
     - API versioning strategy
     - OpenAPI schema generation
     - Complete CRUD endpoint examples
   - **Key features:**
     - Workspace-scoped data operations
     - Role-based access control (owner, admin, member, viewer, system_admin)
     - Consistent error response format
     - Pagination metadata (total, limit, offset, hasMore)
     - TypeScript code examples with Zod validation
     - Implementation checklist for new endpoints

**Technical Quality:**

- TypeScript: ✅ pass (0 errors)
- ESLint: ✅ pass (1 pre-existing warning in API acceptable)
- Prettier: ✅ formatted
- Git: ✅ committed and pushed to main

**Commit:**

- `153e9ae` - "docs: add comprehensive api design specification"

### Purpose & Impact

This specification serves as the **P0 leverage document** for all remaining development work:

- **Options A-D readiness:** Provides foundation for agent builder, production readiness, workflow system, and enhanced features
- **API consistency:** Ensures all endpoints follow same patterns (pagination, filtering, errors)
- **Developer onboarding:** New engineers can reference this single source of truth
- **Quality gates:** Checklist ensures no endpoints ship without proper validation, auth, workspace scoping
- **OpenAPI integration:** Ready for automated API docs generation

### Next Steps Recommendations

**Priority 1: Testing Strategy & Standards** (next doc to create)  
Now that API patterns are defined, document:

- Unit test guidelines and coverage goals
- Integration testing patterns for APIs and UI
- E2E test cases and frameworks
- Mocking and test data management

**Priority 2: Execute Options A-D**  
With API spec in place, proceed with:

- Option A: Agent Builder (visual workflow creator)
- Option B: Production Readiness (testing, monitoring, optimization)
- Option C: Workflow System (automation platform)
- Option D: Enhanced Features (segments, CRUD modals, filtering)

---

## 💡 Implementation Notes

**Pattern Used** (replicate for CRM pages):

```typescript
"use client";

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useWorkspace } from "@/contexts/workspace-context";
import { Spinner } from "@/components/ui/spinner";
import { toast } from "sonner";

export default function PageName() {
  const { currentWorkspace } = useWorkspace();
  const [data, setData] = useState<Type | null>(null);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchData() {
      if (!currentWorkspace?.id) return;

      try {
        setIsLoading(true);
        const res = await fetch(`/api/endpoint?workspaceId=${currentWorkspace.id}`);
        if (!res.ok) throw new Error("Failed to fetch");
        const json = await res.json();
        setData(json.data);
      } catch (error) {
        toast.error("Failed to load data");
      } finally {
        setIsLoading(false);
      }
    }

    fetchData();
  }, [currentWorkspace?.id]);

  if (isLoading) return <div className="flex h-full items-center justify-center"><Spinner /></div>;

  return <div>{/* Render with real data */}</div>;
}
```

**Key Points**:

- Always check `currentWorkspace?.id` before fetching
- Use Spinner component for loading states
- Use toast.error() for error notifications
- Keep existing UI components unchanged
- Add TypeScript interfaces for API responses

---

## 🚫 Out of Scope (Deferred to Week 4+)

Per Guardrails Protocol, these items are **explicitly deferred**:

- ❌ Transcriptions feature (Twilio integration)
- ❌ Page Agents system
- ❌ Audio processing
- ❌ Meeting AI
- ❌ New complex features

**Focus**: Connect existing pages to existing APIs only.

---

**End of Session Status**

_Next session: Continue with CRM Core pages (customers, contacts, projects, prospects)_  
_Estimated time to complete Week 1: 6-8 hours_

---

## 🎯 Week 2 Summary

### What Was Accomplished

**Foundation Complete:**

- ✅ Navigation audit (106 pages documented)
- ✅ New IA design (workflow-centric structure)
- ✅ 44 middleware redirects implemented
- ✅ My Work hub created and functional
- ✅ Sidebar navigation updated
- ✅ 28 pages migrated to new structure
- ✅ CRM hub page created

**Structure:**

```
Primary Navigation:
├── My Work (/my-work) - NEW ✨
├── Dashboard (/dashboard)
├── Agents (/agents)
├── CRM (/crm/*) - NEW GROUP ✨
├── Analytics (/analytics/*)
├── Library (/library/*) - RENAMED from /knowledge ✨
└── Automations (/automations)
```

**Impact:**

- All old URLs work via redirects (backward compatible)
- Clearer mental model for users
- Easier feature discovery
- Scalable structure for future growth
- Mobile-responsive design maintained

### Week 2 Status: 85% Complete

**Completed (85%):**

- ✅ Navigation audit and IA design
- ✅ Middleware redirects
- ✅ My Work hub
- ✅ Sidebar updates
- ✅ CRM, Library, Business, Developer, Data page migrations
- ✅ CRM hub page

**Optional Remaining (15%):**

- ⏳ Business hub page (`/business/page.tsx`)
- ⏳ Developer hub page (`/developer/page.tsx`)
- ⏳ Data hub page (`/data/page.tsx`)
- ⏳ Automations hub page (`/automations/page.tsx`)

**Decision:** Hub pages are nice-to-have. Core Week 2 objective (navigation refactor) is COMPLETE.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option A: Complete Week 2 Hub Pages (2 hours)

Create remaining 4 hub pages for complete IA

### Option B: Start Week 3 - API Connections (RECOMMENDED)
