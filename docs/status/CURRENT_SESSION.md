## 💡 Quick Start for Tomorrow

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd /c/Users/Owner/workspace/galaxyco-ai-2.0

# 2. Pull latest changes (if working from different machine)
git pull origin main

# 3. Start development server (if needed for reference)
cd apps/web && pnpm dev

# 4. Share wireframes/screenshots via:
#    - Upload images to chat
#    - Share Figma links
#    - Describe layouts in detail

# 5. AI will build pages autonomously based on designs

# 6. Quality checks before commit
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test:run  # Run all 519 tests
```
