2. Files validate (size, type)
3. Upload starts with progress bar
4. Item appears in "Recently Uploaded" section
5. Status shows "Processing..." or "Ready"

---

### ✅ 5. Navigation Integration (COMPLETE)

**File:** `apps/web/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`

**Changes:**

- ✅ Added "Knowledge" nav item with 📚 icon
- ✅ Positioned between Dashboard and Agents
- ✅ Active state styling
- ✅ Hover effects

---

## 📊 Architecture Decisions

### Multi-Tenant Security

- Every table has `workspace_id` foreign key
- All API endpoints require `workspaceId` query param
- Clerk authentication on all routes
- No cross-tenant data access possible

### File Upload Flow

```
User Upload → API Validates → DB Record Created (status: processing)
                   ↓
            TODO: Upload to Storage (Vercel Blob/S3)
                   ↓
            TODO: Background Job Processes File
                   ↓
            TODO: Extract Text/Generate Embeddings
                   ↓
            DB Updated (status: ready, content: extracted_text)
```

### Data Model

```
knowledge_items (main table)
├── Basic Info (title, type, status)
├── Source (sourceUrl, fileName, fileSize, mimeType)
├── Processed Content (content, summary, embeddings)
├── Organization (collectionId, tags)
└── User Actions (isFavorite, isArchived)
```

3. Tagging UI
4. Item detail views

**Result:** Beautiful, complete UI (backend processing can come later)

### Option C: RAG-First Path (4-5 hours)

Focus on AI integration:

1. Embeddings generation
2. Semantic search
3. Agent context integration
4. File storage + basic processing

**Result:** AI-powered knowledge base ready for agent use

## 📦 Dependencies Needed (Not Yet Installed)

For document processing:

- `pdf-parse` - PDF text extraction
