# Session Recap — GalaxyCo.ai Foundation Build (Patched Final)

## What Changed In This Patch
- Added **API & Data Contracts (OpenAPI + Events) — V1 (Patched)** with:
  - Billing/Usage endpoints (`/billing/budget`, `/billing/invoices`, `/usage/outcomes`, overage toggle, credit pack checkout)
  - Locked `Approval.scope` enum
  - Knowledge endpoints (ingest, coverage, grounded Q&A)
- Added **WSAO Metering & Billing — Stripe + Entitlements (Patched)** with:
  - Price ID placeholders & Entitlements matrix
  - Duplicate collapse & partial batch refund rules
  - Ledger constraints and idempotency keys
- Tiny quote fix: backticks render correctly for literal **`@`** in Warp docs; no TODO left.

## Next 48 Hours — Highest Leverage
1) **Fill pricing numbers** (plan prices, WSAO included, overage) and map to **Entitlements matrix**.
2) **Wire CI secrets/vars** and create **ECR repos**; prove first ECS deploy.
3) **Implement Knowledge endpoints** (ingest/coverage/qa) to satisfy Docs & Knowledge Pack.

## Handoff Notes
- All patched docs are copy‑ready; use them to seed repo (`/docs`), Terraform (`infra/terraform`), and Warp Drive (`/warp`).
- Stripe: create Products/Prices → paste `price_...` IDs into server config and **Pricing doc**.
