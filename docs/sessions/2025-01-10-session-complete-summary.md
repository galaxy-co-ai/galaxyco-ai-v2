- ✅ Test infrastructure fully operational
- ✅ All automation scripts executable

### Needs Attention

- ⚠️ Auth pages (sign-in, sign-up) fail in tests
  - **Reason**: Clerk authentication required
  - **Solution**: Mock Clerk in tests or test with authenticated state
  - **Impact**: Low - can skip auth page screenshots for now

### Future Enhancements

- 🔮 Sentry API integration (need auth token)
- 🔮 Auth page testing with Clerk mocks
- 🔮 CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions)
- 🔮 More viewport configurations
- 🔮 Component-level screenshot tests

## 🎯 Next Steps

### When You Continue:

**Option A: Continue Phase 3 - Manual UI Audit**

1. Start dev server: `pnpm dev`
2. Manually review each page for issues
3. Document findings in `docs/incidents/2025-01-10-ui-audit-findings.md`
4. Categorize issues (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

**Option B: Skip to Phase 4 - Start Fixing Issues**
If you already know what needs fixing:

1. Create fix list
2. Apply fixes one by one
3. Test each fix with automation scripts
4. Commit fixes with proper format

**Option C: Test the Infrastructure**

1. Run `./scripts/ui-audit.sh` to see full report
2. Run `./scripts/smoke-test.sh` for quick validation
3. Try `pnpm playwright show-report` to see test results
4. Review captured screenshots
