# Working Docs Directory

**Purpose**: Collaborative workspace for documentation in active development

## üìÅ Directory Structure

```
working/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This file - workflow guide
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ drafts/                # Your initial documentation (unreviewed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reviewed/              # AI-reviewed & polished docs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ final/                 # Approved docs ready for production
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _archive/              # Old versions for reference
```

## üîÑ Documentation Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **You Create** ‚Üí Place in `drafts/`

When you write documentation, place it in the `drafts/` folder:

```bash
# Example
docs/working/drafts/agent-execution-flow.md
docs/working/drafts/database-schema-v2.md
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **AI Reviews** ‚Üí Moves to `reviewed/`

I will:

- ‚úÖ Check for clarity, completeness, and accuracy
- ‚úÖ Enhance formatting and structure
- ‚úÖ Add missing sections or examples
- ‚úÖ Ensure consistency with project standards
- ‚úÖ Move to `reviewed/` folder with revision notes

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **You Approve** ‚Üí Moves to `final/`

After you review my changes:

- If approved ‚Üí Move to `final/` and integrate into main docs
- If needs revision ‚Üí I'll update based on your feedback

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Integration** ‚Üí Deploy to main docs

Final docs get moved to appropriate locations:

- Architecture docs ‚Üí `docs/knowledge-base/architecture/`
- Feature specs ‚Üí `docs/knowledge-base/features/`
- Workflows ‚Üí `docs/knowledge-base/workflows/`
- Runbooks ‚Üí `docs/runbooks/`
- etc.

- Use clear, descriptive headings (H2 ##, H3 ###)
- Code blocks must specify language: \`\`\`typescript
- Include examples for all code snippets
- Use tables for structured data
- Add emojis for visual scanning (sparingly)
- Keep lines under 120 characters

### **Content Rules**

- Write in present tense ("The system does X" not "will do")
- Be specific (avoid "soon", "later", "basically")
- Include "Why" not just "What" and "How"
- Link to related documentation
- Update last modified date
- Add your name as author/contributor

### **File Naming**

## üí° Tips for Great Documentation

1. **Start with "Why"** - Explain the problem before the solution
2. **Use Examples** - Code samples, screenshots, diagrams
3. **Think Future You** - Will you understand this in 6 months?
4. **Link Generously** - Connect related concepts
5. **Version Control** - Note when things change and why
6. **Keep It Fresh** - Delete outdated docs, don't hoard
7. **Test It** - Follow your own instructions to verify accuracy

**Questions?** Ask in any session and I'll help refine this workflow!
