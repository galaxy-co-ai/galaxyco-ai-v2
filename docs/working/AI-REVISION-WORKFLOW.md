# AI Revision Workflow 📝

**How AI Revises Your Documents to Meet Quality Standards**

**Created**: 2025-10-11  
**Status**: Active Process

---

## 🎯 The Core Concept

**You create → AI revises → AI seeks approval → AI integrates**

Unlike traditional workflows where AI just "extracts" from your docs, **AI will revise and improve the documents themselves** before they become part of the project knowledge base.

---

## 📊 The 3-Phase Process

### Phase 1: You Create (In `drafts/`)

**What you do:**

- Research topics on the internet
- Copy-paste findings into template
- Add your notes and thoughts
- Don't worry about polish or perfection
- Include EVERYTHING interesting (AI will filter)

**Location**: `docs/working/drafts/your-doc.md`

**Tell AI**: "Please review your-doc.md in working/drafts"

---

### Phase 2: AI Revises (Moves to `reviewed/`)

**What AI does:**

#### 2.1 Critical Analysis

- Read all your findings
- Evaluate relevance to project
- Assess fit with architecture
- Identify what's MVP vs V1 vs V2
- Spot conflicts and issues
- Formulate recommendations

#### 2.2 Document Revision

AI **rewrites your document** to:

- ✅ Remove irrelevant/noisy information
- ✅ Add "AI Critical Analysis" section
- ✅ Organize findings by priority:
  - **Implement Now** - Fits MVP needs
  - **Adapt** - Needs modification
  - **Defer** - Good but premature
  - **Skip** - Doesn't fit use case
- ✅ Add trade-off analysis you might have missed
- ✅ Flag questions needing human judgment
- ✅ Include implementation guidance
- ✅ Add success criteria
- ✅ Clean up formatting and structure

#### 2.3 Quality Check

Before moving to `reviewed/`, AI ensures:

- [ ] Clear executive summary with recommendation
- [ ] All findings categorized (Implement/Defer/Skip)
- [ ] Reasoning provided for each recommendation
- [ ] Conflicts highlighted
- [ ] Questions flagged for human decision
- [ ] Noise removed
- [ ] Trade-offs explained
- [ ] Implementation plan included
- [ ] Next steps clear

**Location**: `docs/working/reviewed/your-doc.md`

**AI will tell you**:

- What was kept and why
- What was removed and why
- What questions need your input
- What it recommends implementing

---

### Phase 3: You Approve → AI Integrates

#### 3.1 Your Review

Look at the revised document and:

- **Option A**: "Looks good, integrate" → Proceed to integration
- **Option B**: "Change X in section Y" → AI revises again
- **Option C**: "Let's discuss..." → Conversation to clarify

#### 3.2 AI Integration (After Your Approval)

AI moves doc to `final/` and creates artifacts:

**Artifacts Created**:

1. **ADRs** (Architecture Decision Records)
   - For major technical decisions
   - Placed in `docs/knowledge-base/architecture/`

2. **Implementation Guides**
   - Step-by-step how-to docs
   - Code examples adapted to our stack
   - Placed in `docs/knowledge-base/workflows/`

3. **Runbooks**
   - Operational procedures
   - Placed in `docs/runbooks/`

4. **API Documentation**
   - If research involves APIs
   - Placed in `docs/technical/api/`

5. **Code Examples**
   - Real implementation code
   - Added to appropriate codebases
   - With tests and documentation

6. **Updated Related Docs**
   - Links added to related documentation
   - Cross-references updated
   - Indexes refreshed

**Location**: Appropriate place in main docs structure

**Git Commit**: Proper conventional commit message

## 🔍 Example: Before & After

### Your Original Draft

```markdown
# Research: WebSocket Authentication

I found 5 different ways to do WebSocket auth:

1. Token in query string
2. Token in initial handshake
3. Cookie-based auth
4. Custom protocol upgrade
5. JWT in WebSocket frame

All have pros and cons. Here's a bunch of code examples I found...

[Paste of 10 code examples from various sources]

I think maybe option 2 or 3 could work?
```

### AI Revised Version

````markdown
# Research: WebSocket Authentication with Clerk

**Status**: Reviewed by AI  
**Recommendation**: Implement Option 2 (Token in Handshake)  
**Confidence**: High

## Executive Summary

After evaluating 5 authentication approaches, **token in initial handshake**
(Option 2) is the best fit for our Clerk-based auth and multi-tenant architecture.

## 🤖 AI Critical Analysis

### Recommendation: Implement Token in Initial Handshake

**Why this approach:**

1. **Clerk compatible**: Works with clerk.session.getToken()
2. **Multi-tenant safe**: Token contains workspaceId
3. **Standard pattern**: Widely adopted, well-documented
4. **Secure**: Token never exposed in URL or logs
5. **Simple**: 30 lines of code vs 100+ for alternatives

### What to Implement Now

**Token in Initial Handshake** (Option 2)

- Priority: High
- Effort: 1 day
- Security: ✅ Secure
- Depends on: Existing Clerk auth

### What to Skip

**Token in Query String** (Option 1)

- Skip because: Security risk (tokens in server logs/browser history)
- Alternative: Use handshake auth instead

**Cookie-based Auth** (Option 3)

- Skip because: Conflicts with Clerk's token-based model
- Would require: Separate cookie management system

**Custom Protocol Upgrade** (Option 4)

- Skip because: Over-engineered for our needs
- Complexity: Not justified for MVP

**JWT in WebSocket Frame** (Option 5)

- Skip because: Adds latency (auth on every message)
- Defer until: If we need message-level auth (unlikely)

### Implementation Plan

1. **Client Side** (apps/web) - 2 hours
   ```typescript
   // lib/websocket.ts
   const token = await clerk.session?.getToken();
   const socket = io(WS_URL, {
     auth: { token },
   });
   ```
````

2. **Server Side** (apps/api) - 4 hours

   ```typescript
   // middleware/ws-auth.ts
   io.use(async (socket, next) => {
     const token = socket.handshake.auth.token;
     const session = await verifyClerkToken(token);
     socket.workspaceId = session.workspaceId;
     socket.userId = session.userId;
     next();
   });
   ```

3. **Testing** - 2 hours
   - Test valid token → connection success
   - Test expired token → connection rejected
   - Test missing token → connection rejected
   - Test token refresh on reconnect

### Trade-offs

**If we implement:**

- ✅ Secure, standard approach
- ✅ Works with existing auth
- ✅ Easy to test and maintain
- ⚠️ Need token refresh logic for long connections

**If we defer:**

- ❌ No real-time features possible
- ❌ Polling adds latency and cost

### Questions for Human Decision

None - this is a clear choice based on requirements.

### Success Criteria

- [ ] WebSocket connections authenticate via Clerk token
- [ ] Invalid tokens are rejected before connection
- [ ] workspaceId and userId available in socket context
- [ ] Token refresh works on reconnection
- [ ] No auth-related WebSocket errors in production

## 🎯 Key Differences

### Traditional Workflow
```

You research → Dump everything → AI extracts some parts → Messy docs

```

### Our Workflow
```

You research → Capture everything → AI analyzes & revises →
AI removes noise → AI adds analysis → Clean, actionable docs

```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Better Research Docs
1. **Capture liberally** - AI will filter, not you
2. **Add context** - Why this is relevant to our project
3. **Include versions** - "Works in v2.3" matters
4. **Rate sources** - AI trusts higher-rated sources
5. **Ask questions** - Use "My Notes" sections

### For Better AI Revisions
1. **Be specific** in AI Review section - "Focus on security"
2. **Provide context** - Current scale, team size, timeline
3. **Flag concerns** - "I'm worried about X"
4. **State preferences** - "Simple > complex for MVP"
5. **Ask AI to challenge** - "Push back if this is overkill"

### For Better Outcomes
1. **Review AI's reasoning** - Learn from the analysis
2. **Challenge back** - "But what about Y?"
3. **Iterate** - "Revise section X with more detail"
4. **Document decisions** - "We chose A because..."
5. **Trust the process** - AI filters noise so you don't have to

## 🚦 When AI Might Push Back

**Good scenarios where AI should challenge:**

```

You: "I researched microservices patterns"
AI: "Before implementing, let's discuss if we need this.
We're 1 dev with 0 users. Microservices add 10x complexity.
Recommend monolith with module boundaries instead.
Can extract services later when we have 5+ engineers."

```

```

You: "Found this advanced caching strategy"
AI: "This is for 1M+ requests/sec. We're at 10 req/sec.
Premature optimization. Recommend simple Redis cache first.
Revisit this at 100k req/sec."

```

```

You: "Research on Kafka for event streaming"
AI: "Kafka excels at scale we don't have yet.
For < 1000 msg/sec, Redis Streams or BullMQ is simpler.
$50/mo vs $500/mo infrastructure.
When should we need Kafka's scale?"

```
