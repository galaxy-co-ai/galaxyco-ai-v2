## üìã AI Review & Revision Process

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: AI Must Use Critical Judgment**

### Phase 1: Critical Analysis

**AI will NOT blindly implement everything in this research!**

Instead, AI will:

1. **ANALYZE** - Evaluate all options critically
2. **JUDGE** - Determine what truly fits our project
3. **FILTER** - Separate signal from noise
4. **CHALLENGE** - Question assumptions and bad ideas
5. **CLARIFY** - Ask questions about unclear requirements

### Phase 2: Document Revision

AI will revise this document to:

- [ ] **Extract** only what's relevant to our current needs
- [ ] **Highlight** approaches that align with our architecture
- [ ] **Flag** suggestions that don't fit our use case
- [ ] **Add** trade-off analysis I might have missed
- [ ] **Document** clear recommendations with reasoning
- [ ] **Remove** noise and irrelevant information
- [ ] **Organize** findings by priority and fit
- [ ] **Add** implementation guidance for approved items
- [ ] **Create** an "AI Assessment" section with critical analysis

### Phase 3: Approval & Integration

Once AI revises the document to meet quality standards:

1. **Move to `reviewed/`** - Document is enhanced and ready
2. **Create AI Analysis Summary** - Executive assessment
3. **Present to user** - Show what was kept, removed, and why
4. **Wait for approval** - User reviews AI's judgment
5. **Move to `final/`** - After user approval
6. **Extract artifacts** - Create ADRs, guides, code examples
7. **Integrate** - Place in appropriate docs locations

### AI's Quality Standard Checklist

Before moving to `reviewed/`, document must:

- [ ] Have clear executive summary with recommendation
- [ ] Separate "Implement Now" vs "Defer" vs "Skip"
- [ ] Include reasoning for each recommendation
- [ ] Highlight conflicts with our architecture
- [ ] Identify decisions needing human judgment
- [ ] Remove irrelevant/noisy information
- [ ] Add trade-off analysis
- [ ] Include implementation priorities
- [ ] Have clear next steps

### AI Analysis Section (Added by AI)

AI will add this section during revision:

```markdown

```

### Your Role as User

After AI revises and moves to `reviewed/`:

1. **Review AI's analysis** - Do you agree with the assessment?
2. **Answer questions** - Provide clarification on flagged items
3. **Approve or revise** - "Looks good" OR "Change X"
4. **Make final calls** - On questions AI flagged for human decision

### AI's Role

- ‚úÖ Critical technical advisor
- ‚úÖ Filter signal from noise
- ‚úÖ Revise docs to professional standard
- ‚úÖ Extract only what fits our project
- ‚úÖ Challenge bad ideas
- ‚úÖ Add missing analysis
- ‚ùå NOT a blind copy-paste machine
- ‚ùå NOT required to use everything you found

## üìù Template Usage Notes

### Tips for Gathering Research:

1. **As You Read**: Copy-paste key info immediately with source
2. **Be Liberal**: Include everything interesting, AI will help prioritize
3. **Context Matters**: Note why something is relevant to our project
4. **Ask Questions**: Use "My Notes" sections to add your thoughts
5. **Mark Quality**: Rate sources so AI knows what to trust
6. **Link Everything**: More citations = better
7. **Include Examples**: Code, configs, screenshots
8. **Note Date**: Tech info ages quickly

### You Don't Need to Fill Every Section:

- Skip sections that don't apply
- Add new sections if needed
- Focus on what's relevant
- AI will reorganize and enhance

### How AI Will Transform This:

After you create a research doc, AI will:

- Extract action items and decisions
- Create architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Generate code examples adapted to our project
- Create implementation guides
- Update relevant project documentation
- Identify conflicts with current implementation
- Suggest experiments or proof-of-concepts
- Create decision log entries
