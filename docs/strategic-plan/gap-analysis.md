   - Add leads, email_sequences, crm_updates tables
   - Generate and test migrations

2. **Lead Intel database integration** (2 hours)
   - Save enrichment results to DB
   - Add status tracking (pending → enriched → approved)

3. **Lead management UI** (4-5 hours)
   - List view with filters
   - Detail view with enrichment data
   - Approve/reject actions

4. **Lead management APIs** (2-3 hours)
   - GET /api/leads (list with pagination)
   - POST /api/leads/[id]/approve
   - POST /api/leads/[id]/reject

**Total Critical Path**: **12-15 hours** to complete Phase 1

---

### **Nice to Have (Post-Beta)** 🟡

1. **Learning from feedback** - Improve agents based on user edits
2. **Autonomous lead discovery** - Find leads automatically
3. **Advanced analytics** - ROI calculator, performance trends
4. **A/B testing** - Test different email approaches

---

## 💡 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### **1. Stay Focused on MVP** ✅

**Current approach is correct**: Build Lead Intel → Outreach Writer → CRM Sync in sequence. Don't try to do everything at once.

### **2. Leverage Existing Strengths** ✅

- Knowledge base system is MORE capable than strategic plan expected
- UI component library is production-quality
- Multi-tenant architecture is solid

**Recommendation**: Reuse existing patterns, don't reinvent.

### **3. Prioritize User Feedback Loops** 🔴

**Gap**: Supervised automation isn't fully implemented (approve/reject).

**Recommendation**: Add approval UI BEFORE building next agent. This is the core value prop!

### **4. Database First, Then UI** ✅

**Current approach is correct**: Extend schema, then build APIs, then UI. This order prevents rework.

### **5. Knowledge Base Integration is Critical** ⚠️

**Gap**: KB exists but not used by agents yet.

**Recommendation**: Connect KB to Lead Intel (ICP scoring) and Outreach Writer (case studies) BEFORE building CRM Sync.
