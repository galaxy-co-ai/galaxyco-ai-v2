## Notes & Considerations

### Technical Debt to Address
1. **Replace temp-workspace-id** - Implement proper workspace context
2. **Error handling** - Standardize error responses across APIs
3. **Testing** - Add unit & integration tests (Vitest, Playwright)
4. **Type safety** - Ensure all API responses are properly typed
5. **Database migrations** - Document all schema changes

### OpenAI API Considerations
- **Vector Stores:** Consider migrating to OpenAI's hosted vector stores if costs are manageable ($0.10/GB/day)
- **File Search Tool:** Can simplify RAG implementation vs custom
- **Agents SDK:** Explore OpenAI's agents SDK for multi-agent workflows
- **Realtime API:** Budget for WebSocket infrastructure and audio costs

### Infrastructure Needs
- **Redis/Upstash:** For caching and rate limiting
- **Queue System:** BullMQ or Inngest for background jobs
- **Monitoring:** Sentry + Vercel Analytics + Custom dashboard
- **Backup Strategy:** Automated database backups (daily)
