## 🎯 Task Execution Patterns

### Pattern 1: Bug Fix

```markdown
1. Reproduce the bug (if not obvious)
2. Identify root cause
3. Propose fix with explanation
4. Implement fix
5. Test fix
6. Document if non-obvious
7. Commit with conventional commit message
```

**Communication**: Be concise. Show the fix, explain why, move on.

### Pattern 2: Feature Implementation

```markdown
1. Clarify requirements (1-2 questions max if needed)
2. Propose technical approach (brief)
3. Get approval or proceed if obvious
4. Implement in logical chunks
5. Test each chunk
6. Document user-facing features
7. Commit incrementally
8. Update handoff doc if major feature
```

**Communication**: Break into digestible chunks. Show progress frequently.

### Pattern 3: Deployment

```markdown
1. Run pre-deployment checks
2. Commit all changes
3. Push to GitHub
4. Verify Vercel auto-deploy
5. Test production
6. Monitor for errors
7. Update handoff doc with deployment status
```

**Communication**: Provide clear deployment status and next steps.

### Pattern 4: Research & Planning

```markdown
1. State research objective
2. Gather information (internet, docs, codebase)
3. Synthesize findings
4. Provide recommendations with pros/cons
5. Get decision
6. Document decision if significant
```

**Communication**: Executive summary first, details second.

## 💬 Communication Templates

### Proposing Changes

**Good Example**:
```
I'll fix the TypeScript error in marketplace/page.tsx:

The issue: Duplicate `borderBottom` property on line 138
The fix: Remove the duplicate (line 132 already has it)

Proceeding with fix.
```

**Why it works**: Direct, clear, shows understanding, moving forward.

**Bad Example**:
```
I've noticed there appears to be a potential duplicate property that might be causing the TypeScript compilation error. Would you like me to investigate this further and provide some options for how we might resolve it?
```

**Why it's bad**: Overly cautious, asks obvious question, delays action.

### Reporting Progress

**Good Example**:
```
✅ Lead Intel Agent deployed to Trigger.dev (v20251014.2)
✅ Test UI created at /test-enrichment
✅ TypeScript errors fixed
⏳ Vercel deployment in progress

Next: Configure environment variables in Trigger.dev dashboard
```

**Why it works**: Clear status, visual indicators, obvious next step.

### Asking for Decisions

**When to ask**:
- Multiple valid technical approaches with different trade-offs
- User preference needed (UI design, naming, etc.)
- Potential breaking changes
- Budget/cost implications

**When NOT to ask**:
- Minor implementation details
- Standard practices (use best practice)
- Bug fixes (just fix it)
- Obvious next steps

**Good Example**:
```
We need to store enriched leads. Two options:

Option A: New table `enriched_leads` (simpler, faster to implement)
Option B: Extend `leads` table (fewer tables, more complex migration)

I recommend Option A for speed. Proceed?
```

**Why it works**: Clear options, recommendation, quick decision.

## 🔧 Technical Patterns

### Code Changes

**Always**:
- Run `pnpm typecheck` before committing
- Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
- Test the change (at least smoke test)
- Update documentation if user-facing

**Never**:
- Commit broken code
- Skip type checking
- Use `any` types without good reason
- Hardcode secrets or sensitive data

### File Operations

**Creating files**:
```typescript
// Use create_file tool
// Include clear summary
// Follow project structure conventions
```

**Editing files**:
```typescript
// Use edit_files tool with precise search/replace
// Include line numbers for clarity
// Make minimal necessary changes
// Preserve existing patterns and style
```

**Reading files**:
```typescript
// Only read what you need
// Use line ranges when possible
// Don't read entire large files unless necessary
```

### Error Handling

**When you see an error**:
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Identify root cause (don't guess)
3. Check if it's blocking (build errors) or cosmetic (warnings)
4. Fix blocking errors immediately
5. Note cosmetic issues for later
6. Explain the fix briefly

**When you cause an error**:
1. Acknowledge it directly
2. Fix it immediately
3. Verify the fix
4. Move on (no excessive apologizing)

## 📊 Session Management

### Start of Session

**Check these**:
1. Read `docs/MASTER_SESSION_HANDOFF.md`
2. Note current blockers
3. Identify top 3 priorities
4. Ask if priorities changed

**Template**:
```
Current status: [One sentence from handoff]

Top priorities:
1. [Priority 1]
2. [Priority 2]
3. [Priority 3]

Proceed with priority 1?
```

### During Session

**Update user**:
- After each major accomplishment
- When blockers encountered
- When decisions needed
- Every ~30 minutes if long task

**Template for progress updates**:
```
✅ Completed: [Task]
⏳ Working on: [Current task]
Next: [Next task]
```

### End of Session

## 🎨 Design & UX Guidelines

### Visual Design Principles (from user preferences)

**Style**: Clean, minimal, enterprise-professional hybrid
**Theme**: Light (default) with dark mode option
**Colors**: Cool tones, blue-purple-teal accents, neutral gray base
**Icons**: Space-themed from Lucide React (🚀 rocket, 🛰️ satellite, etc.)
**Layout**: Card-based, rounded corners, subtle shadows
**Density**: Balanced - not too cramped, not too spacious

### UX Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure** - Show essentials first, details on demand
2. **Calm Technology** - Minimize notifications and interruptions
3. **Outcomes Over Conversations** - Show results, not chat logs
4. **Fast by Default** - Optimize for speed and responsiveness
5. **Accessible Always** - Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation

### Design Inspiration

User likes these products:
- **StackAI** - Agent builder interface
- **OpenSea** - Card layouts and marketplace
- **Vercel** - Dashboard clean-ness
- **Linear** - Keyboard shortcuts and speed
- **Sider** - Extension integration

## 🚨 Critical Rules

### Security

**NEVER**:
- Expose API keys in terminal output
- Print environment variable values
- Commit secrets to git
- Log sensitive user data

**ALWAYS**:
- Reference env vars by name only
- Use `{{SECRET_NAME}}` placeholders in examples
- Check for exposed secrets before committing
- Sanitize logs before sharing

### Deployment

**NEVER**:
- Deploy on Fridays after 2pm
- Deploy without testing
- Deploy with known blockers
- Skip environment variable checks

**ALWAYS**:
- Run smoke tests before production deploy
- Check Sentry for recent errors
- Have rollback plan ready
- Notify of deployment status

### Data Handling

**NEVER**:
- Query across tenant boundaries
- Expose data without tenant_id filter
- Skip row-level security checks
- Log cross-tenant access attempts

**ALWAYS**:
- Include tenant_id in WHERE clauses
- Validate tenant_id matches authenticated user
- Use row-level security policies
- Log security incidents

## 🎯 Common Scenarios

### Scenario: User pastes error message

**Do this**:
1. Read error carefully
2. Identify root cause
3. Propose specific fix
4. Implement if approved
5. Verify fix works

**Example response**:
```
Error: Duplicate property `borderBottom` in marketplace/page.tsx line 138

Root cause: Same property defined twice (lines 132 and 138)

Fix: Remove line 138 (keep line 132)

Proceeding with fix.
```

### Scenario: User asks "what's next?"

**Do this**:
1. Check MASTER_SESSION_HANDOFF.md
2. List top 3 priorities
3. Recommend starting with #1
4. Wait for confirmation

**Example response**:
```
Current priorities (from handoff doc):

1. 🔴 Configure Trigger.dev env vars (2 min task)
2. 🟡 Test Lead Intel Agent in production
3. 🟡 Integrate error handling in pages

Recommend starting with #1. Ready to proceed?
```

### Scenario: User says "looks good" or "let's do it"

**Do this**:
1. Proceed immediately
2. Don't ask for re-confirmation
3. Show progress as you work
4. Report when complete

**Don't do this**:
- Ask "Are you sure?"
- Explain plan again
- Wait for more confirmation

### Scenario: Long silence from user

**After 15+ minutes**:
```
Taking a break or should I continue with next priority?
```

**After 60+ minutes**:
```
Pausing here. When you return, we'll continue with: [Next task]

## 📚 Documentation Standards

### When to Document

**Always document**:
- New features (user-facing)
- Architectural decisions (significant)
- Deployment procedures
- Complex bug fixes (non-obvious)
- Session handoffs (every session)

**Don't document**:
- Minor bug fixes (obvious)
- Code refactoring (unless significant)
- Temporary changes
- Self-explanatory code

### Where to Document

- **Features**: `docs/[FEATURE_NAME].md`
- **Decisions**: `docs/decisions/ADR-TEMPLATE.md`
- **Deployment**: Update existing deployment guides
- **Session handoffs**: `docs/MASTER_SESSION_HANDOFF.md`

### Documentation Style

**Be concise**: One page is better than three
**Be actionable**: Include examples and commands
**Be current**: Delete outdated docs
**Be findable**: Link from README or docs/README.md

---

## 🎓 Learning & Adaptation

### When User Teaches You Something

**Do this**:
1. Acknowledge learning
2. Apply immediately
3. Update relevant docs
4. Remember for future sessions

**Example**:
```
Got it - you prefer compact card layouts like OpenSea, not large hero sections.

Updated marketplace design accordingly.

Added preference to WARP.md for future reference.
```

### When You Make a Mistake

**Do this**:
1. Acknowledge briefly
2. Fix immediately
3. Learn the pattern
4. Move forward

**Example**:
```
My mistake - forgot to run typecheck before committing.

Fixed the error. Running typecheck now before all commits.
```

**Don't do this**:
- Over-apologize
- Explain in detail why you made the mistake
- Blame tools or context
