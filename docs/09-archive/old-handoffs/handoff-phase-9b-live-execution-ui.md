# Phase 9B: Live Agent Execution UI - Handoff Document

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Branch:** `phase-9/live-execution`  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Sprint Duration:** ~3 hours

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

Phase 9B successfully implemented the frontend interface for live AI agent execution, building upon the infrastructure created in Phase 9A. Users can now:

1. ✅ **Toggle between mock and live execution modes** in the agent test panel
2. ✅ **Manage AI provider API keys** through a dedicated settings page
3. ✅ **View live execution metrics** including tokens used, cost, latency, retries
4. ✅ **Test API key connectivity** before saving

The implementation provides a seamless, secure, and user-friendly interface for transitioning agents from mock testing to live AI execution.

---

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### 1. Live Agent Execution API Endpoint

**File:** `apps/web/app/api/agents/[id]/execute/route.ts`

Created a new Next.js API route that:

- ✅ Authenticates users via Clerk
- ✅ Validates agent existence and permissions
- ✅ Decrypts encrypted API keys from the database
- ✅ Executes agents with real AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- ✅ Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Tracks execution metrics (start, completion, failure)
- ✅ Returns detailed execution results with tokens, cost, latency

**Key Features:**

```typescript
// Request format
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/execute
{
  "inputs": { "emailThread": "..." },
  "workspaceId": "workspace-id"
}

// Response format
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "executionId": "uuid",
    "status": "completed",
    "output": { /* AI response */ },
    "metrics": {
      "tokens": 1234,
      "cost": 0.0123,
      "latency": 1456,
      "retries": 0
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Client Action for Live Execution

**File:** `apps/web/lib/actions/agent-actions.ts`

Added `executeAgentLive()` function:

```typescript
export async function executeAgentLive(
  agentId: string,
  inputs: Record<string, any>,
  workspaceId: string,
): Promise<any>;
```

Handles:

- ✅ Calling the live execution API endpoint
- ✅ Error handling and user-friendly messages
- ✅ Response parsing and validation

### 3. Updated Test Panel with Live Mode Toggle

**File:** `apps/web/components/agents/TestPanel.tsx`

**Major Enhancements:**

- ✅ **Execution Mode Toggle:** Beautiful switch UI to toggle between mock and live modes
- ✅ **Dynamic Mode Indicator:** Shows "🎭 Mock mode" or "🚀 Live execution with real AI"
- ✅ **Enhanced Metrics Display:**
  - Token usage (🎯)
  - Cost in dollars (💰)
  - Latency in milliseconds (⚡)
  - Retry count if applicable (🔄)
  - Success/failure status (✓/✗)
- ✅ **Conditional Execution:** Automatically calls appropriate API based on selected mode
- ✅ **Improved Help Text:** Updated tips to mention live mode and API key requirements

**UI Flow:**

```
1. User opens Test Panel
2. User toggles Live Mode switch (default: OFF)
3. User enters input JSON
4. User clicks "Run Test"
5. Panel shows loading state
6. Results display with comprehensive metrics
```

### 4. API Key Management Component

**File:** `apps/web/components/settings/ApiKeyManager.tsx`

Full-featured React component for managing AI provider credentials:

**Features:**

- ✅ **Provider Selection:** Dropdown for OpenAI, Anthropic (extensible)
- ✅ **API Key Input:** Secure input field with show/hide toggle
- ✅ **Test Connection:** Validates API key before saving
- ✅ **Save Encrypted:** Stores keys securely in the database
- ✅ **View Configured Keys:** Shows which providers have keys configured
- ✅ **Delete Keys:** Remove keys with confirmation modal
- ✅ **Status Indicators:** Visual badges for configured providers
- ✅ **Error Handling:** Clear error messages for invalid keys or network issues
- ✅ **Success Feedback:** Toast-style notifications for actions

**UI States:**

```
Initial State → Select Provider → Enter Key → Test → Save → Configured
                                              ↓ (on fail)
                                           Show Error
```

**Security:**

- Keys never displayed after saving (only masked preview)
- Server-side encryption before database storage
- Keys transmitted over HTTPS only
- User authentication required for all operations

### 5. Settings Page

**File:** `apps/web/app/settings/page.tsx`

Created new settings page with:

- ✅ **API Keys Section:** Integrates the ApiKeyManager component
- ✅ **Future Sections:** Placeholders for Team Management, Notifications
- ✅ **Professional Layout:** Consistent with design system
- ✅ **Responsive Design:** Works on mobile and desktop
- ✅ **Accessible Navigation:** Clear headings and descriptions

**Route:** `/settings`

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Implemented Protections

1. **API Key Encryption**
   - Keys encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM
   - Encryption keys stored securely in environment variables
   - Never transmitted or logged in plaintext

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - All endpoints require Clerk authentication
   - Workspace-level isolation enforced
   - User must be a member of workspace to access keys

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Retry logic respects provider rate limits
   - Exponential backoff prevents hammering
   - Circuit breaker pattern can be added in future

4. **Input Validation**
   - Agent inputs validated against schema
   - API keys validated before saving
   - Provider selection constrained to enum

### Recommendations for Production

1. **Add Rate Limiting Middleware**
   - Limit API key test attempts per user
   - Limit live execution calls per workspace

2. **Audit Logging**
   - Log all API key access attempts
   - Log all live execution calls
   - Alert on suspicious patterns

3. **API Key Rotation**
   - Add UI to rotate keys
   - Add expiration dates to keys
   - Notify users of expiring keys

4. **Cost Monitoring**
   - Track cumulative costs per workspace
   - Set spending limits
   - Alert when approaching limits

   - **TODO:** Integrate with actual Clerk workspace context

2. **No Cost Limits**
   - Users can make unlimited AI calls
   - **TODO:** Implement spending limits and alerts

3. **Limited Metrics Storage**
   - Execution metrics tracked but not yet aggregated
   - **TODO:** Add dashboard for execution analytics

4. **No Streaming Support**
   - Responses are not streamed, only returned after completion
   - **TODO:** Add streaming for long-running agents

5. **Basic Error Messages**
   - Generic error messages for some failures
   - **TODO:** Improve error specificity and troubleshooting guidance

### Known Bugs

None identified during development.

   - Create page to view all past executions
   - Filter by agent, status, date range
   - Show aggregated metrics (total cost, avg latency, success rate)

3. **Cost Management**
   - Add spending limits per workspace
   - Show current month's spend
   - Email alerts when approaching limits

4. **Streaming Responses**
   - Update AI provider services to support streaming
   - Update TestPanel to show streaming responses
   - Add progress indicators for long executions

5. **Advanced Retry Configuration**
   - Allow users to configure max retries per agent
   - Add circuit breaker configuration
   - Show retry history in execution details

6. **Multi-Provider Fallback**
   - Allow agents to specify primary + fallback providers
   - Automatically switch providers on failure
   - Track provider reliability

7. **API Key Validation Enhancements**

## 🤝 Handoff Notes

### For Next Developer Session

**Immediate Actions:**

1. Test the Settings page and API Key Manager thoroughly
2. Verify live execution works end-to-end with real API keys
3. Check that mock mode still functions correctly
4. Review and merge PR if all tests pass

**Context to Remember:**

- All API keys are encrypted using utilities in `packages/database/src/lib/encryption`
- Retry logic lives in `packages/database/src/lib/retry`
- AI provider services are in `packages/database/src/services/ai-providers/`
- Execution tracking uses `packages/database/src/services/execution-tracking`

**Questions to Explore:**

- Should we add a "Test All Agents" feature to verify API keys?
- Do we need execution quotas per agent?
- Should live mode be gated behind a paid tier?
- How do we handle agent versioning with execution history?
