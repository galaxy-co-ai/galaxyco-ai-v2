## 🧠 Key Context

### **Architecture Stack**

- **Orchestration**: LangGraph (TypeScript) with StateGraph
- **AI Providers**: OpenAI (primary), Anthropic Claude (fallback)
- **Function Calling**: OpenAI strict mode for structured outputs
- **State Management**: SQLite checkpointing, Zod schemas
- **Real-Time**: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Database**: Postgres (Neon) with new tables for PAA, notifications, metrics

### **Dashboard Design** (from research)

- Single-column "Today" focus view
- 5 essential cards max
- Keyboard-first (A/D/S/W, ⌘K)
- Calm notifications (ambient/batch/immediate levels)
- Progressive disclosure
- No dark patterns

### **AI Intelligence Pattern**

```
User Request
  → PAA Intake (analyze)
  → Planner (break into subtasks)
  → Router (select specialist)
  → Specialist (execute with approval)
  → Critic (evaluate)
  → PAA Summarize (user-facing outcome)
  → Dashboard (real-time display)
```

### **PAA (Personal AI Assistant)**

- Runs silently in background (no chatbot UI)
- Watchtower: Detects issues every 5 min
- Optimizer: AI-powered suggestions daily
- Healer: Auto-fixes known issues
- All activity logged to database

## 💡 Important Decisions Made

### **1. Why LangGraph?**

- Built-in state management with checkpointing
- Human-in-the-loop support out of box
- Visual debugging of execution graphs
- Retry/fallback logic included
- TypeScript support with Zod schemas

### **2. Why OpenAI Strict Mode?**

- Guaranteed schema adherence
- No hallucinated fields
- Reliable structured outputs
- Reduced prompt engineering

### **3. Why Calm Notifications?**

- User research shows notification spam reduces productivity
- Batch digests more effective than real-time alerts
- Ambient badges for routine events
- Immediate alerts only for critical (3 types)

### **4. Why Intelligence-First?**

- Dashboard is useless without real AI outcomes
- Building UI before data leads to rework
- Real outcomes inform dashboard design
- Validates core value prop early

### **5. Why PAA Background Service?**

- Proactive > reactive
- Auto-fixes reduce support burden
- AI-powered suggestions > manual rules
- Silent operation > chatbot clutter

## ⚠️ Blockers & Risks

### **Current Blockers**

- None (ready to start)

### **Potential Risks**

1. **LangGraph Learning Curve**: Mitigated with docs provided
2. **Token Costs**: Mitigated with intelligent model router
3. **SSE at Scale**: Plan includes fallback to polling
4. **Timeline Aggressive**: 22 days with 70hr/week = achievable
5. **Context Loss**: Mitigated with this document
