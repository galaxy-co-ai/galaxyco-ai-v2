# Current State Summary

**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Branch:** `feature/sales-workflow-foundation`  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for UI Rebuild

## ✅ What We Accomplished

### 1. Cleaned Mock/Demo Data
- ✅ Removed 8 fake agents from dashboard
- ✅ Removed 6 fake templates from marketplace
- ✅ Set all stats to zero/empty
- ✅ Added proper empty states with CTAs
- **Result:** Clean slate, no fake data, production-ready look

### 2. Simplified Design System
- ✅ Installed Pico CSS for automatic semantic styling
- ✅ Trimmed global CSS from 700+ lines to 31 lines
- ✅ Simplified Tailwind config (layout utilities only)
- ✅ Created deprecated design-system stub (keeps legacy components working)
- **Result:** Modern foundation, ready for new UI

### 3. Migrated Dashboard Components (Reference Pattern)
- ✅ AgentFilters - clean search and filter chips
- ✅ AgentCard - simplified card structure
- ✅ AgentGrid - minimal styles
- ✅ ProgressTracker - clean progress UI
- **Note:** These will still be replaced during rebuild, but serve as migration examples

### 4. Established Rebuild Documentation
- ✅ `REBUILD-PLAN.md` - Phased 10-week rebuild roadmap
- ✅ `NEW-COMPONENT-GUIDE.md` - Patterns for new components
- ✅ `mock-data-cleanup.md` - Record of what was removed
- ✅ Updated design-system stub with clear warnings
- **Result:** Clear path forward for complete UI rebuild

## 📊 Current Component Status

### ✅ Cleaned (Production Ready)
- Dashboard page (empty state functional)
- Marketplace page (empty state functional)
- Core layouts and navigation

### 🔄 Legacy (To Be Replaced)
**37 components** using old design-system stub:

- **Agents:** 12 files (140-853 lines each)
- **Marketplace:** 9 files
- **Knowledge:** 6 files  
- **Layout/Settings:** 10 files

**These are NOT being migrated.** They work via the stub and will be completely replaced during the UI rebuild from wireframes.

## 🎯 Next Steps (Your Roadmap)

### Phase 1: Wireframe & Design (Week 1-2)
**Before any coding:**
1. Finalize wireframes for all pages
2. Establish brand colors/typography
3. Create design system v2 tokens
4. Get approval on visual direction

Questions to answer:
- What's the exact color palette?
- Which fonts? (currently using Pico defaults)
- 4px or 8px spacing grid?
- Dark mode support?
- Animation level?

### Phase 2: Foundation (Week 3-4)
**Build core structure:**
1. Create `/components/v2/` folder structure
2. Build new layout components (Header, Sidebar, Container)
3. Set up design-system-v2 with approved tokens
4. Create shared components (EmptyState, Loading, Error)

### Phase 3: Page-by-Page Rebuild (Week 5-12)
**Replace pages in priority order:**
1. Dashboard (Week 5)
2. Agent Management (Week 6-7)
3. Marketplace (Week 8)
4. Knowledge Base (Week 9)
5. Settings (Week 10)
6. Polish & Optimization (Week 11-12)

**For each page:**
- Follow `NEW-COMPONENT-GUIDE.md` patterns
- Build in `/components/v2/[section]/`
- Use semantic HTML + Tailwind + Pico
- Test thoroughly before replacing old page
- Remove old component files

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### ✅ For NEW components (do this):
```typescript
// components/v2/dashboard/StatsCard.tsx
export function StatsCard({ title, value }: Props) {
  return (
    <article className="bg-white rounded-lg p-6 shadow-sm">
      <h3 className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">{title}</h3>
      <p className="text-3xl font-bold mt-2">{value}</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```

### ❌ For OLD components (don't do this):
```typescript
// DON'T waste time migrating these
import { colors, spacing } from '@/lib/constants/design-system';
// These will be completely replaced
```

## 🚀 How to Start Rebuilding

### When Wireframes Are Ready:

1. **Create new component:**
   ```bash
   # Follow the template in NEW-COMPONENT-GUIDE.md
   touch components/v2/dashboard/StatsCard.tsx
   ```

2. **Build with clean patterns:**
   - Semantic HTML
   - Tailwind classes only
   - No design-system imports
   - Proper TypeScript types
   - JSDoc comments

3. **Test thoroughly:**
   - Desktop, tablet, mobile
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader
   - Loading/error/empty states

4. **Replace old component:**
   ```bash
   # Update imports in pages
   # Remove old component file
   # Test entire feature flow
   ```

5. **Commit and deploy:**
   ```bash
   git add components/v2/dashboard/StatsCard.tsx
   git commit -m "feat(dashboard): add new StatsCard component"
   ```
