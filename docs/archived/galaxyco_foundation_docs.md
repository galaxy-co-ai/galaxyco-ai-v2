# GalaxyCo.ai — Foundational Documents (Updated)

Intro
This is the master index and working outline for GalaxyCo.ai 2.0. It reflects our agreed vision anchored in StackAI (polish), OpenSea (marketplace cards), OpenAI Agent Builder (simplicity), and Sider (human knowledge UI) — multi‑agent Packs, a Personal AI Assistant for every user, guided onboarding (≤90s), personalized dashboards, transparent KPIs/citations, and a community marketplace.

Use this as the top doc in Gamma/Warp. Keep it table‑free and copy‑ready.
