# Release Notes: v0.9.0-beta.9b (Phase 9B)

Date: 2025-10-08
Branch: phase-9/live-execution
PR: #1 (fix/web): Phase 9B complete – zero TypeScript errors

Summary

- Completed Phase 9B: TypeScript cleanup and final polish for workspace context + live execution UI.
- Achieved 0 TypeScript errors; build, typecheck, and lint pass locally.
- Standardized design system usage (primaryColor/successColor/warningColor, fontFamily.sans, easing.default).
- Fixed agent test and publish flows; wired agent actions to authenticated headers via useWorkspaceAuth.
- Added ESLint config (next/core-web-vitals) and fixed JSX escape issues.

Risk and Impact

- Medium risk: touches UI components and hooks; no database schema changes.
- Impact: Enables deployment to staging for Phase 9B with multi-tenant workspace context and live agent execution flows.

Rollback Plan

- If issues arise post-merge, revert PR #1 from GitHub.
- For any follow-up hotfixes, create a fix/\* branch from phase-9/live-execution and submit PR.

Verification Checklist

Next Steps

- Merge PR into phase-9/live-execution after review.
