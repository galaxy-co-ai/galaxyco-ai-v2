## Quick Start Guide

### First Time Setup
1. Make scripts executable (if needed):
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```

2. Run health check to verify everything is configured:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/health-check.sh
   ```

3. If all checks pass, start development:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

### Daily Development Workflow
1. Run health check:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/health-check.sh
   ```

2. Start dev server (in one terminal):
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. Open database viewer (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/open-drizzle-studio.sh
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Script Permission Errors
If you get "Permission denied" errors:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### TypeScript Errors
If health check fails on TypeScript:
```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm typecheck
```
Fix any errors shown, then run health check again.

### Missing Environment Variables
If health check reports missing vars:
1. Open `apps/web/.env.local`
2. Add the missing variable(s)
3. Run health check again
