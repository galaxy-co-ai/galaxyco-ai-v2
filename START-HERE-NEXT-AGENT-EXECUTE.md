## ✅ Quality Standards

### Must Pass Before Deploy:
```bash
# Run these after each phase
pnpm test:run tests/unit tests/component  # Must be 21/21 passing
pnpm typecheck                             # Must be 0 errors
pnpm lint --fix                            # Must be clean
```

### Visual Quality Check:
- Does landing page look as good as Linear? ✅
- Does Grid look as good as Make.com? ✅
- Does Assistant work like ChatGPT? ✅
- Are all pages consistent? ✅

---

## 🚨 Important Context

### Dalton's Decisions:
1. ✅ **Cleanup first** - Remove clutter before building
2. ✅ **Keep Framer blue** - Don't switch to Linear purple
3. ✅ **All three features** - Ambitious but achievable
4. ✅ **Linear aesthetic** - Minimal, spacious, professional

### What's Already Done:
- Kibo UI integrated (22 components)
- Framer brand applied
- Tests passing (21/21)
- Cursor optimized (3 MCP servers, 12 commands)
- Comprehensive research complete

### What You're Building:
- Linear-quality minimal UI (cleanup + transformation)
- Make.com Grid canvas (3D isometric nodes)
- ChatGPT-level AI Assistant
