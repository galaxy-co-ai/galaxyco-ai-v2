## 💡 Important: CRM & Marketing

### Why I Stopped at 3/5 Pages

**CRM Page Consideration:**
The current CRM page has:

- `WorkspaceGuard` (important for multi-tenant security)
- API data fetching
- Links to sub-pages (customers, contacts, projects, prospects)

The Figma CRM is a **single-page design** with tabs.

**This requires a decision:**

- Replace completely? (Figma tabs design)
- Keep current + enhance visually? (Add Figma components)
- Hybrid approach for CRM only? (Keep structure, add polish)

**Marketing Page:**

- Ready to deploy
- No security concerns
- Can be replaced directly

## 🎯 Next Steps - Your Decision

### Option 2: "Review First"
