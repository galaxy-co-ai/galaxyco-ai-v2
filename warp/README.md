# Warp Directory

## Purpose

Reserved directory for Warp terminal AI configuration and workflows (if needed in the future).

## Current Status

**Empty** - No Warp-specific configuration currently in use.

## History

Originally contained 4 empty subdirectories (notebooks/, prompts/, rules/, workflows/) that were removed during project organization (October 14, 2025) as they served no purpose.

## Future Use

If Warp terminal requires custom configuration or AI-specific files, they should be placed here with proper documentation.
