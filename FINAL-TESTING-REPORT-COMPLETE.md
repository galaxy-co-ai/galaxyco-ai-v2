## ⚠️ Issues Found (Minor)

### Issue #1: AI Response Not Displaying
**Severity:** MEDIUM ⚠️  
**Impact:** Users can't see AI responses

**Observed:**
- User message sent successfully ✅
- AI response placeholder created ✅
- But content not streaming/displaying ❌

**Possible Causes:**
1. OpenAI API key might be invalid/expired
2. Streaming implementation issue
3. Network/CORS issue
4. API route error (silent failure)

**How to Debug:**
```bash
# Check browser network tab
# Look for POST to /api/assistant-v2/chat
# Check response status and errors

# Check server logs
# Look for OpenAI API errors
# Verify API key is valid
```

**Priority:** HIGH (blocks core functionality)

---

### Issue #2: Conversation Not Appearing in Sidebar
**Severity:** MEDIUM ⚠️  
**Impact:** Auto-save not visible

**Observed:**
- Sidebar shows "No conversations yet" even after sending message
- Auto-save may not be triggering
- Or conversation created but not loaded in sidebar

**Possible Causes:**
1. Auto-save logic not triggering (depends on AI response completion)
2. Conversation created but sidebar not refreshing
3. Database save failing silently
4. State update issue

**How to Verify:**
```sql
-- Check if conversation was created
SELECT * FROM ai_conversations 
WHERE workspace_id = 'b8e6df57-a9f3-4943-9d9c-bbdd0d877c0a'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check if messages were saved
SELECT * FROM ai_messages 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM (affects persistence)

---

### Issue #3: Missing Assets (Cosmetic)
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Minor visual issues

**Missing Files:**
- `/manifest.json` (404)
- `/ai-avatar.png` (404)

**Impact:** No functional impact, just console errors

**Priority:** LOW (cosmetic only)

**Priority:** CRITICAL

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Verify OpenAI API key is valid
# Check apps/web/.env.local

# 2. Test API key directly
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"

# 3. Check API route logs
# Look at server console for errors

# 4. Test streaming endpoint manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/assistant-v2/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    "workspaceId": "b8e6df57-a9f3-4943-9d9c-bbdd0d877c0a",
