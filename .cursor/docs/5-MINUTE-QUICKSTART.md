## 🎯 Try It Out (Next 2 minutes)

### 1. Generate a Component (30 seconds)

Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows)

Type: `generate-component`

Follow the prompts - AI will create:

- Component file with proper patterns
- Test file
- Loading skeleton
- All GalaxyCo standards applied

### 2. Use a Code Snippet (15 seconds)

In any `.tsx` file, type:

```
gsc [Tab]
```

Boom! Instant Server Component template.

**Other snippets to try:**

- `gcc` - Client Component
- `gsa` - Server Action
- `gf` - Form
- `gtc` - Test

### 3. Ask AI to Create a Feature (60 seconds)

Open Cursor Agent (click Agent button or `Cmd+L`)

Say:

```
Create a new feature for managing team tasks using the feature-creation-workflow
```

AI will:

- Plan the architecture
- Generate database schema
- Create Server Actions
- Build components
- Write tests
- Create documentation

**All automatically!**
