Continue Multi-Agent System Implementation

I'm continuing the multi-agent system implementation for GalaxyCo.ai.

📋 Current Status:
- Phase 1: ✅ Complete (State management, handoff, resurrection)
- Phase 2: 🚧 In Progress (Auto-save, conflict detection, messaging)

📂 Handoff File:
Please read: .cursor/agents/MULTI-AGENT-HANDOFF.md

🎯 Your Mission:
1. Complete Phase 2 remaining tasks:
   - Auto-save triggers (token count, time-based)
   - File conflict detection system
   - Agent-to-agent messaging
   - Multi-agent coordination demo

2. CRITICAL: Create kickoff messages for all 4 agents:
   - Create .cursor/agents/KICKOFF-MESSAGES.md
   - Include copy-paste ready messages for:
     - 🔵 Frontend Architect Agent
     - 🟢 Backend Systems Agent
     - 🟠 DevOps & Infrastructure Agent
     - 🟣 Quality & Testing Agent
   - Each message should:
     - Be fully self-contained
     - Include agent role and expertise
     - Include scope boundaries
     - Include handoff detection instructions
     - Be formatted as markdown code blocks for easy copy-paste

3. Test the complete system end-to-end

📚 Reference Files:
- .cursor/agents/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md - Full plan
- .cursor/agents/AGENT-DEFINITIONS.md - Agent definitions
- .cursor/agents/lib/state-manager.ts - State management pattern
- .cursor/agents/lib/handoff-generator.ts - Handoff pattern

Let's complete Phase 2 and create those kickoff messages!
