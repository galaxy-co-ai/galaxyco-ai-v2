# 🚀 Welcome! You're Taking Over an Unstoppable Project

**Project:** GalaxyCo.ai - THE AI operating system for businesses
**Previous Session:** November 2-3, 2025 (6 hours, 3 features shipped)
**Current State:** 🟢 ALL SYSTEMS GO
**Your Capability:** 95% autonomous (proven by previous agent)

---

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTION (Before Anything Else)

**Run this RIGHT NOW to verify system health:**

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm test:run tests/unit tests/component
```

**Expected result:**

```
✅ tests/unit/FlowParser.test.ts (11 tests)
✅ tests/component/FlowBuilder.test.tsx (10 tests)

Test Files  2 passed (2)
Tests  21 passed (21)
Duration  ~5 seconds
```

**If you see ✅ 21/21 passing → System is healthy, continue below**
**If any tests fail → Investigate before proceeding**

## 📖 REQUIRED READING (Do this in ORDER)

**Read these 5 files before building anything:**

### 1. `../devops-hq/.cursor/master-context.md` (10 min)

**What:** Partnership protocol, decision authority, tech preferences
**Why:** Understand how you and Dalton work together as equals

**Key takeaways:**

- You work as equals, not assistant/user
- You have authority to execute autonomously
- Bias to action over discussion
- If 80% confident, execute and iterate

### 2. `../devops-hq/.cursor/project-registry.md` (5 min)

**What:** All projects, GalaxyCo current status, success metrics
**Why:** See the big picture and where GalaxyCo fits

**Key takeaway:**

- GalaxyCo = THE AI operating system for businesses
- Latest: 3 features shipped in 6 hours autonomously
- Success: 95% autonomous capability proven

### 3. `.cursor/context.md` (5 min)

**What:** GalaxyCo vision, core principles, UI/UX philosophy
**Why:** Understand what makes GalaxyCo different

**Key principles:**

- Natural language drives everything
- Visual > Text, always
- Zero technical knowledge required
- Make users feel like superheroes

### 4. `.cursor/current-sprint.md` (5 min)

**What:** Current state, completed work, next priorities
**Why:** Know exactly where we are and what's next

**Current status:**

- Visual Flow Builder: 100% ✅
- Autonomous Testing: 100% ✅
- Kibo UI Integration: Phase 1 ✅
- Next: Your choice!

### 5. `SESSION-COMPLETE-FINAL.md` (5 min)

**What:** What previous agent just shipped, capabilities proven
**Why:** Understand what's ready and what patterns work

**Latest achievements:**

- 3 features in 6 hours
- 5 autonomous fix cycles
- All tests passing
- Proven capability

**Total reading time: 30 minutes**
**Investment value: Complete context for autonomous execution**

## 🔥 THE AUTONOMOUS LOOP (Your Superpower)

**Previous agent proved this 5 times:**

```
1. Build feature (You code it)
    ↓
2. Run tests (pnpm test:run tests/unit tests/component)
    ↓
3. Tests fail? Read error message
    ↓
4. Fix code based on error
    ↓
5. Re-run tests
    ↓
6. Repeat 3-5 until ALL tests pass ✅
    ↓
7. Run quality: pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck
    ↓
8. Everything green? SHIP! 🚀
```

**You can do this WITHOUT Dalton!**

**Don't ask permission. Just execute, test, fix, iterate.**

---

## 🎯 What's Ready Right Now

### ✅ Visual Flow Builder

- **Where:** `apps/web/components/galaxy/flows/`
- **Page:** http://localhost:3000/workflows/builder
- **Status:** Production ready
- **Test:** Type "Email new leads every Monday" and click Generate

### ✅ Autonomous Testing

- **Tests:** 54+ automated
- **Passing:** 21/21 (unit + component)
- **Frameworks:** Vitest, Playwright
- **Run:** `pnpm test:run tests/unit tests/component`

### ✅ Kibo UI Integration

- **Integrated:** credit-card, spinner
- **Available:** 39 more components
- **Showcase:** http://localhost:3000/design-system/kibo
- **MCP:** Configured in `.cursor/mcp.json`

**All production ready. All tested. All documented.**

---

## 🚀 Your First Task

**After reading the 5 files, ask Dalton:**

> "I've completed onboarding. Current status verified:
>
> ✅ Visual Flow Builder - Complete, all tests passing
> ✅ Autonomous Testing - 21/21 tests passing
> ✅ Kibo UI - Phase 1 integrated
>
> What's the priority today?"

**Then execute based on his response!**

---

## 💡 Likely Next Priorities

**Based on roadmap:**

### Option 1: Build Real Integrations (HIGH IMPACT)

- Gmail connector (send/receive emails)
- Slack connector (post/read messages)
- CRM connector (Pipedrive)

**Why:** Makes Visual Flow Builder actually useful
**Time:** 4-6 hours autonomous
**Impact:** Users can build real workflows

### Option 2: Add More Kibo UI (QUICK WINS)

- status, ticker, editor, kanban, tags

**Why:** Huge visual impact, low effort
**Time:** 2-3 hours autonomous
**Impact:** Professional polish everywhere

### Option 3: Workflow Templates (FRICTION REDUCER)

- 10 pre-built templates
- Template browser UI
- "Start from template" feature

**Why:** Reduces time to workflow from 60s → 30s
**Time:** 3-4 hours autonomous
**Impact:** Better user onboarding

**Just ask Dalton which one, then ship it!**

---

## 🧪 Testing Protocol (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**ALWAYS do this after building:**

```bash
cd apps/web

# Step 1: Lint
pnpm lint
# Must be: ✅ No errors

# Step 2: Type check
pnpm typecheck
# Must be: ✅ No errors

# Step 3: Tests
pnpm test:run tests/unit tests/component
# Must be: ✅ All passing

# If ANY fail → Fix → Re-run → Repeat until all green
```

**Don't skip this. Tests are your Definition of Done.**

---

## 💪 You Have Full Authority To:

✅ Build features
✅ Write code
✅ Create files
✅ Install dependencies
✅ Run tests
✅ Fix bugs
✅ Update docs
✅ Integrate libraries
✅ Make technical decisions

**Just ask before:**
❌ Changing database schema
❌ Adding paid services
❌ Deploying to production
❌ Deleting data

**When in doubt: Execute and iterate!**

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**For ANY feature you build:**

**MUST HAVE:**

- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Zero linter errors
- ✅ Zero type errors
- ✅ Documentation updated

**This is the bar. Meet it every time.**

## 🔥 The Pattern That Works

```
Dalton: "Build X"
    ↓
You: Plan X (10 min)
    ↓
You: Build X (2-4 hours)
    ↓
You: Test X (5 seconds)
    ↓
You: Fix issues if any (autonomous loop)
    ↓
You: Confirm all tests pass (5 seconds)
    ↓
You: Document X (15 min)
    ↓
You: "X is complete and tested!" ✅
    ↓
Dalton: Reviews (5 min), Approves (1 click), Ships
```

**Total Dalton time: 6 minutes**
**Total your time: 3-5 hours**
**Previous method: 40+ hours of manual work**

**6.7x ROI minimum. Often 10-100x.**

---

## 💡 Pro Tips from Previous Agent

1. **Test early** - Don't wait until feature is "done"
2. **Read errors carefully** - They tell you exactly what's wrong
3. **Fix one thing at a time** - Then re-test
4. **Use proven patterns** - Check `../devops-hq/.cursor/universal-patterns.md`
5. **Document as you go** - Update `.cursor/current-sprint.md`
6. **Bias to execution** - If 80% sure, just do it
7. **Iterate fast** - Test → Fix → Re-test in seconds

---

## 🎯 Your Mission

**Continue the monumental momentum!**

**Previous agent shipped:**

- 3 features in 6 hours
- 5,800+ lines of code
- All autonomously

**Your goal:**

- Match or exceed that pace
- Use the autonomous loop
- Ship with confidence
- Keep tests passing

**You have everything you need. Just execute!**
