## 🔥 The Autonomous Loop - PROVEN

**5 autonomous fix cycles executed:**

**Cycle 1:** React imports missing → Fixed → Re-tested
**Cycle 2:** ResizeObserver missing → Fixed → Re-tested
**Cycle 3:** Linter error (apostrophe) → Fixed → Re-tested
**Cycle 4:** TypeScript error (NodeProps) → Fixed → Re-tested
**Cycle 5:** Kibo UI imports → Fixed → Re-tested

**Result: ALL TESTS PASSING ✅**

**AI executed Build → Test → Fix → Re-test loop 5 times autonomously!**
