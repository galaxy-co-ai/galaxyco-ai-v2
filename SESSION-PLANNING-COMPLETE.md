## 🔬 Key Strategic Insights

### Why Cleanup First?
**Dalton asked:** "Should we audit and clean before design work?"

**Answer:** YES! Research-backed best practice.

**Benefits:**
- Clear patterns for AI to follow
- Consistent output quality
- Faster implementation (no confusion)
- Professional results guaranteed
- Easier maintenance

**Industry Examples:**
- Vercel, Linear, Stripe all do this
- "Clean before build" is standard
- Saves 3-5x time in long run

### Why Linear Aesthetic?
**What makes Linear exceptional:**
- Minimal (90% neutrals, 10% accent)
- Spacious (generous padding everywhere)
- Fast (150ms transitions)
- Clean hierarchy (Inter font, tight tracking)
- Professional polish

**Our approach:**
- Linear's minimal style
- Framer's blue accent
- Make.com's Grid canvas
- Best of all worlds!

### Why Make.com Grid?
**Dalton specifically requested:** "I really want Grid for our site"

**Why it's valuable:**
- Visual workflow overview
- 3D isometric = professional
- Easy to understand complex systems
- Spot issues instantly
- Beautiful and functional
