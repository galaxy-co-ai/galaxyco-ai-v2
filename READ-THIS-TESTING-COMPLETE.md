## 🚀 RECOMMENDED SOLUTION (30 Minutes)

### **Copy Working `/assistant` Code** ⭐

The existing `/assistant` page WORKS perfectly. Let's use it!

**Steps:**
```bash
1. Open: apps/web/app/(app)/assistant/page.tsx
2. Copy the chat hook usage
3. Apply to ChatContainer.tsx  
4. Test - should work immediately!
5. ✅ DONE - full functionality!
```

**Why This Works:**
- `/assistant` page already has working AI streaming
- Same database, same auth, same everything
- Just different UI component
- Proven architecture
- **30 minutes vs. 2-4 hours debugging**

**After This:**
- ✅ AI streaming works
- ✅ Auto-save triggers
- ✅ Sidebar updates
- ✅ Full testing possible
- ✅ Deploy with confidence!
