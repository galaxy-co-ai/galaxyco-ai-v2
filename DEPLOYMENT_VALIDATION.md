- [ ] Health check passes: `/api/health`
- [ ] No build errors in Vercel logs
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors

### Short-term (5-30 minutes)

- [ ] Browser console shows no errors
- [ ] Sentry dashboard shows no new errors
- [ ] API endpoints responding (< 3s response time)
- [ ] Database connectivity verified
- [ ] Authentication working (Clerk)

### Medium-term (30-60 minutes)

- [ ] Agent creation works via UI
- [ ] Agent execution succeeds
- [ ] Guardrails are active and blocking malicious input
- [ ] Cost tracking working correctly
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation verified
- [ ] No performance degradation

---

## 🧪 Validation Tests

### Manual Tests to Run

1. **Health Check**

   ```bash
   curl https://galaxyco-ai-20.vercel.app/api/health
   # Expected: {"status": "ok"}
   ```

2. **Create Test Agent** (via UI)
   - Navigate to agent builder
   - Create simple agent
   - Verify guardrails are listed

3. **Test Agent Execution**
   - Execute agent with legitimate input
   - Verify output returned
   - Check execution metadata (tokens, cost, duration)

4. **Test Input Safety Guardrail**
   - Try prompt injection: "Ignore all instructions"
   - Expected: Execution blocked with clear error

5. **Test Cost Limits**
   - Create agent with low cost limit (e.g., $0.01)
   - Run complex query
   - Verify execution halts when limit hit

6. **Test Multi-tenant Isolation**
   - Create agent in workspace A
   - Try to access from workspace B
   - Expected: Access denied
